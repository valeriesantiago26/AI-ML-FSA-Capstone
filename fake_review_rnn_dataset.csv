Good flavor.,1
"I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.",1
My husband bought this gel for us. The gel caused irritation and it felt like it was burning my skin. I wouldn't recommend this gel.,1
My boyfriend and I bought this to spice things up in the bedroom and we were both highly disappointed in this product. We bought this one because we absolutely love the ky yours and mine and we thought this would have a similar affect but it did absolutely nothing. Do not buy.,1
Bought this earlier today and was excited to check it out. Based on the product description I was expecting something but it was just like the regular KY. We are fans of the his and hers so we just expected more and were left a little disappointed.,1
I bought this product for my husband and I to try and we were not impressed at all. There was no tingling or warming. It left us both very sticky. I have used KY products in the past (loved KY his and hers) but this one was disappointing.,1
My husband and I bought this for some extra fun. We werevboth extremely disappointed. Especially for the price! Do not waste your money on this product. We felt nothing but a sticky mess from it.,1
Got as a surprise for my husband there is nothing special about it just a lube save the money and get plain KY if you just need a lube wish I could return it for a refund,1
tried it with my husband and felt no different there was no effect no change first te using ky gel not sure if i want to try any others...,1
Purchased this thinking it would have some sort of warming effect but it's the same as the original. Don't waste your money.,1
"Bought this to enhance our time a bit, did abslutely nothing very disappointed especially because its almost 20!",1
I bought this after really liking the his n hers variety but this is nothing like that very disappointed with this product.,1
First time purchase of this type of product. Maybe I expected too much. Did not think there was any warming feeling at all. Left us sticky! Even after trying to was it off.,1
I bought this and tried this with my wife but we did not enjoy it ..we did not feel anything enhancement with this product at all such as the his-her product.,1
I bought this product to spice things up with my fianc and it didn't do anything! No passion. Will not buy again,1
"I bought this to try to spice things up, but I felt nothing. Very disappointing to be honest.",1
"I bought this because it had better reviews than the his and hers jelly, but I feel like it didn't work that well for us. It was kind of warm-feeling, but that's about it. I guess I don't know what's supposed to happen! Lol",1
It was my first time using k-y. It didn't do anything in my opinion it felt like every time we did anything. Then again was my first time so probably did Somthing wrong.,1
"I noticed this product on clearance at a store I shop frequently and decided to give it a try. My husband and I LOVE it! We went back and bought every box left! I, like others have mentioned, am not sure what it is supposed to do other than be a lubricant but for that purpose we like it much better than regular KY Jelly (which tends to dry out and disappear for us). This product stays on for awhile and makes for a very pleasurable experience. The only drawback is that we find it to be a bit sticky. After applying it with your hands you're left with a sticky hand and I agree a little goes a long way! I personally have to be very careful with all products due to skin irritation and surprisingly this actually seems to help that. I did NOT receive a sample and never have.",1
I used this product a couple of times since i recived it free to try and it has been a good experiance it feel warm so its a pretty good sensation so i recomend.,1
"Used a few times stays a bit sticky but not too bad, better than most products",1
Loved This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
This is a good product. Will give you a great feeling.,1
"I really enjoyed using this product with my husband. After 20+ years of marriage, things can tend to get a little tired and boring. This was just the thing we needed to shake things up a bit. The packaging and pump dispenser is awesome. The product itself does not disappoint. A little goes a very long way. It provides a slight warming sensation when in use and does not become sticky or tacky in anyway. This is an excellent choice for an intimate lubricant. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100 my own.",1
Awesome Product for couples. It is a warm feeling lubricant and not sticky like a lot of other lubricants.It is very easy to clean up after use.I will absolutely be purchasing more in the future. I received this product free for the purpose to give my review..Opinions are 100 my own!,1
"Exceptional product, this is smooth, not slimy and the warming sensation is an experience that both partners should share at least once in their lifetime. Great way to shake things up!",1
I used this for the first time with my boyfriend and he loved it just as much as I did. Didn't get sticky and felt great the entire time.,1
Great product! Exactly what it says works very well,1
"yes, the scent is the best. if you like lemon frosting you won't be able to get enough of this lotion. but also, it's almost 100 natural, none of the yucky ingredients like in major brands of lotion. no mineral oil, no petroleum, etc. but also, it completely works. you know how sometimes you opt for organic choices and it's good, but not as good as popular but nastier brands jr watkins delivers. this lotion softens your hands and body, leaves you ungreasy and smells perfect. even my fiance likes it and uses it and he's pretty much anti-lotion in all regards. the price is absolutely right, too--get it!",0
"The Hand-Cream-Lemon-Cream has such a refreshing fragrance. I wish it would last all day. It is soothing to the hands and I get compliments when I use it especially from my daughters and granddaughters, they want me to get some for them It is one of my favorite hand creams. I wish Watkins still had the vanilla body cream that too was a favorite.",1
Smells like a lemon cookie. Absolutely love!!! My kids love it.,1
You will LOVE this lotion. I smile every time I put it on.,1
This hand cream is so nice that I had it on my desk at work and someone stole it after just two days! Broke my heart a little,1
"I love this lotion. Nice and thick, great fragrance. I use it on my hands and my feet.",1
Not sure how this works with clearing your complexion (been using for 2 weeks now) but does keep your skin smooth and clean.,0
Makes my skin feel clean and not super dry where its ashy if i dont follow with a moisturiser as soon as im done. The skin doesnt feel oily or tacky. Makes my skin more radiant and use of foundation and concealer is not needed to make the skin look even and hydrated.,0
It makes my face feel nice and fresh. After about 3 days i did get slight acne but it cleared right back up! Will deff use this every day from now on!,0
"I have used this soap for years and considered it Wal-Mart's best kept secret. I was so disappointed when they stopped carrying it in our store location. Was delighted to see I could get it online it ended up a blessing. I don't go to Wal-Mart as often so I'm saving money there (Sorry Walmart), delivery was prompt, I stockpiled and never left the house.",0
I WON'T recommend this product to anyone,1
My 8 month old baby got extremely irritated from this product after using for less than a week. I would like to get my money back.,1
"I did receive 1 bottle but when I ordered, it said a pack of 6. I was disappointed about that. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"You would think it's convenient to have bubble bath and wash in the same container, but it just means you buy twice the amount... My son loves the bubbles though so no complaints.",1
"Well, Johnson's need I say more I know, right. Ok, but I will. I have used Johnson's since I was a baby, yes it's been a long time. But let's get to the Chase, it's 2 in 1. Come on, who doesn't like 2 in 1 It's hard enough to get the little loves clean, so any help is always a blessing... So, Johnson's Bubble Bath and wash is a must have in this house!!!",1

"The bubbles aren't over the top fabulous, but it smells good and makes the kids happy.",0
I ma using this for my baby when she is one month old. I don't like much fragnanaces hence i love it. I don't feel like using another one.,1
Lots of fun in the bath but have to use a lot to make it bubble! Nice addition when the kids don't want to take a bath.,1
Amazing product. My 3 years old loves her bubble baths.,1
I absolutely love this bubblebath. It smells so good and it body wash too. My little one has very sensitive skin so this is a great option for her to still enjoy bubbles and not break out.,1
I bought a small sample size of this a couple months back and loved it. The smell is just wonderful. I recently bought a new bottle and think that I may have to keep it in my shower and buy my kids another one!,1
Very pleasant smell. Only need a little for a whole lot of bubbles.,1
My babies love the bubbles and mom loves that is tear free and the fragrance,1
My son loves this product. Makes bath time more fun and looks forward to it. Not only is it bubbles but also body wash. The 2- in-1 makes it convenient for me,1
Really liked the fresh smell of this.,1
"This cream did not do much for my face or throat area. I have gone back to my generic brand, it works better and is not as expensive. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I used (and loved) this product for several years until they changed it. It used to moisturize my skin and left it feeling soft. Now, it sits on top of my skin and is never absorbed. It just leaves a slimy film on my skin. I will no longer purchase this product.",1
"I have been using Oil of Olay for over 20 years. This product worked so well for me, but the new formula is HORRIBLE! I cannot find anything to work for my skin like it did! The smell is flowery and it is too thick. The old formula was so light",1
"I am so disappointed! I have used this product for years because of it's soft smell and great results. The new formula feels greasy, smells awful and I don't feel like my skin looks as toned and wrinkle free anymore. This was a five star product for so many years...why change it Please bring back the old formula.",1
"I've been using this product for years and it was terrific. This improved formula is terrible. It doesn't have the hydrating power it had -- it's much thinner and stickier. Heaven help you if you get some on your lips - it tastes terrible! PLEASE dump this improved formula. Until then, I'm shopping for a new moisturizer... alas",1
"It took me so long to find a moisturizer that worked well for me and I loved this product. However, this new formula has a smell that is too strong for me and feels very greasy once applied. Unfortunately I will no longer be purchasing this product and will have to search again for another moisturizer. Please Olay, bring back your old formula. It was so much better.",1
"Used to swear by this product as my daily moisturizer. I loved it because it felt thick and creamy and did a great job without being greasy or feeling heavy. However, just bought the first container of the new formula. It's terrible! It leaves a greasy feel that does not go away and makes it impossible to apply makeup, even 10 minutes after. Your skin just feels slimy to the touch, slippery. And the scent is way stronger. Please, OLAY, give us our old formula back!! I'll be purchasing something else.",1
Olay don't work for me I have overly dry skin. I haven't found anything to work on my skin. So I'm hoping to be able to find something that will work. But I'm affrid I won't be able to find anything to help my skin not be so dry. It gets so bad the I dig at my legs all the time.,1
I used it for several days in a row and I felt like I was wearing a mask. And my skin felt unnatural and dry under it. My skin felt coated instead of hydrated. I will not purchased this product again.,1
"I buy Olay Regenerist all the time from CVS and Rite Aid. This time around I purchased it from Wal Mart's online store, and when I received it, the formula was slightly different. The lotion smells like the cheaper products Olay makes. I am very disappointed and will not order from Walmart online again.",0
"my mother and i have vowed by this product for years and years... when i first started paying attention to skincare, she gave me a bottle of olay regenerist and it's all i've ever needed ... the only thing that works (and i have spent so much money exploring more high-end brands)! so you can understand why i'm upset that the formula was tampered with... this new and improved cream smells awful (the scent is way too strong), it appears that they've watered it down, it's mushy on my face and if i touch my face at any point during the day, it starts peeling off... it's greasy and does not work well under makeup at all! my mom and i are now forced to look for a whole new line of products when we've stayed with olay for our whole lives. sad, sad, sad. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!",1
"While this product probably does leave faces feeling nourished, I would not recommend using it as a daily moisturizer under makeup. It left my face full of crumbles as soon as I brushed on my makeup. Would probably be better as a night cream.",1
Just didn't have the moisture I am used too. Thought I would try this but will go back to Nutragena,1
GreatGreatmefeels great smells great succulent took away dry skin silky smooth enriching,1
"Today is my first time using this product. Felt great going on immediately, felt moisturized without being too greasy. Although it smells great I would have loved to have this formula in a fragrance-free option, my skin tends to be a little sensitive to fragrances, but I will give a final review in a couple of weeks",1

I use this at night for wrinkles on the face. It does a good job reducing wrinkles and taking a couple of years off your face. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"Although this product worked amazingly well, the fragrance gave me headaches and made my eyes water daily-Olay please make more fragrance-free products.",1
"While I do love this product, having used it for at least 10 years, I prefer the old formulation better. I feel the new one doesn't hydrate as well, and leaves a thin film on my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I want to try this so that I can answer these questions. It sounds like a product that would help my skin on my face. I just don't want my face to start sagging. I have always liked olay products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"This product really helped keep my skin moisturized in the winter months. I used it morning and night with good results. It's a little heavy for warmer weather though, with my skin type anyway. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
The product smells amazing need to use more often on my skin.,1
"I love the cleansers but this cream is a little too thick for me...I have trouble going to bed with it on...a bit greasy and has a lot of fragrance. I just purchased the micro sculping cream and I can't wait to try it tonight! One point though, this cream has lasted a very long time, though I don't use it every night becuase it's not my favorite.",1
I like the product but dislike the dispenser. With the hole in the top it is strange to dispense and leaves a mess on the top of the container. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1

Its good cause it works and that's all that matters. .,1
"product seems to work well, I haven't noticed any major antiaging qualities but does seem to help the acne",1
I would recommend this product to those who don't have the money to spend on expensive lotions daily facial products. As we all know older we get we start showing signs of our real age. Olay has products for your every day concerns and cares. I've used Olay products off on for years.,1
smell good because it has a good smell and it should be put in more stores so people can buy it,1
This product works amazing because it not only makes my skin smell great it also keep my skin smooth n healty,1
I would def recommend this product! It smells so good and leave Susie skin soft.,1
"Great smell and feel, would like to try again in future. Thank you",1
"I rated the Olay Micro-Sculpting fragrance free a one because it did not absorb and made foundation glob. It peeled as i rubbed. This formula is much better for day use. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I does hydrate well, haven't seen all my wrinkles dissappear yet. :)",0
I did not like the way it felt on my skin. I felt like I had on some sort of a skin mask. It may be OK for some people. But not for me. The moisturizer does have a creamy texture to it.,0

I have used the product since I was 16 I have tried others just not the same.my mom used it how I learned about it,1
This product has recently changed its formula. I have been using the old formula for years and probably prefer that formula over the new one but it is still too early to judge for certain. I definitely prefer the white dispenser top over the new black one since the residue looks very unappealing on a black surface. Does not look clean which is what you would want your facial products to represent. Overall I still like this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
This product is very good and smells sensational. I recommend for all who have ashy skin! I'm VSOP by nature . Very smooth On point skinn,1
This product is great because it is one of the best moisturizers I have found,1

Works well with skin contour hides blemishes and wrinkles,1
"Have help me look younger for 10 years. Great product for aging skin, recommended to people with heavy rinklles.",1
It's not greases and feels good on your skin. It also gives you a beautiful glow. I used it for about two weeks and saw a difference in in my complexion. I would recommend this product to everyone. I brought some for my sister she also loved it. Then she told her friend and now we all are using it and skin looks moor firm then ever,1
This product is amazing! Awesome work!! It actually works! That's sooooooooo cool!!!,1
The best product. Helps heal dry damaged skin dark circles around the eyes. Your skin will look amazing.,1
"I've only used it for one week, but I have been very impressed. Using the facial mask of my CPAP machine has caused the area around my nose, cheeks and eyes to become really dry, flaky, and raw looking. But after using the cream for one week, I noticed a drastic improvement to my skin. The areas that are irritated by my nose mask are no longer dry and flaky or red and raw. My skin look very fresh and moist. Other moisturizers that I tried made my face look greasy not at all the look I wanted. Thanks for making a product that does just what it is supposed to do. Love it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1

I live in Utah and the air is overly dry. I need a cream for day and night that can leave me feeling hydrated at the end of the day or by the time that I wake up in the morning. It has a nice scent but it's not strong. And I always prefer some scent as opposed to unscented products. I hope it's helping me to minimize aging due to dry skin and sun exposure.

I'm a 56 year old female former smoker with a lot of wrinkles around my mouth and the corners of my eyes. I started using Regenerist Deep Hydration Cream years ago when I took a good look (instead of a glance) at myself for the first time in quite a while.

I have very dry skin and I noticed a difference in a few days,1
"I love this. Tried it once before and it left my face feeling smooth and not the usual dryness. However, before I could finish the jar, my daughter liked it so much, she took it home with her!! Need to try again!",1
My sissy gave me the product 3 yrs ago to try and am so lost with out it .i feel my skin apperence has become that of a 23-year-old. Women and i get many compliments on how young i look. 54 yrs old skin amazing and wrinkle free as far as i can see look and feel great..,1
"This is the best product on the market, I started using Olay products after being told that you should start early taking care of your skin. I was 35 (now 52) and started getting complements on my skin right away. I am still getting those complements, and I am asked what I use. When I tell them about the several Olay products I use daily they tell me that I could do a commercial because they thought I was wearing makeup. I have been sing the praises of Olay from the rooftops. I love my Olay and wouldn't use anything else even if it were free! I look forward to any new products Olay has to offer.

I love this product it is wonderful for sensitive skin.,1
"It works real good on my skin .It the best i have very oily skin and it's heard for me so i really love this.i will tell any and every one to try any of this.My mom,sister and everyone in my family love's it we been for years and we will always use it .",1
"THIS MOISTURIZER REALLY DOES WORK. MY SKIN FEELS LIKE SILK AFTER I HAVE APPLIED IT. I HAD NOT SEEN MY FRIEND FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS WHEN SHE SAW ME, SHE SAID STEP BACK, I HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR FACE.. OK WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, YOUR FACE LOOKS FANTASTIC WELL THAT WAS ALL I NEEDED, I'M HOOKED NOW !!!! THANK YOU OLAY JUDY",1
Doesn't feel cheap and is a good price. Feels nice on the skin and has a good finish. Great product.,1
"I have been using Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream for 5 years, since I was 36 yrs. old, along with some of the other oil of olay products and i'm telling you ladies, it has done wonderful things for my face, my complexion and elasticity of my face. I have no wrincles at all, my face has elasticity and smoothnes. At 41 yrs. of age people thinks I'm 27-32 years old. They jaw drops when I reveal my age to them and they see my 18 and 16 year old daughters with me calling me mom. Thank you Oil of Olay...not even Sephora can make me look this young. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
Seriously effective.mocki.smells great. Safe on your skin. Results are noticeable. Smoother skin.reduced wrinkles. Skin is much softer.younger looking skin. More even complexion. You can wear without makeup or with. Make it a serious part of your cleaning routine.Fresh faced. Smooths application of makeup,1
"I am 41 years old and over the years have spent a small fortune on the latest and greatest facial creams. I have suffered from skin redness/blotchiness and dry/combination skin for the past 10 years. I used this particular regenerist product as a recommendation from a .org website for special skin problems. Within 2 weeks my uneven skin tone has leveled, and I am asked all the time if I am wearing foundation- which I don't! I have paid 4x as much for products that didn't work. I hope they never stop making something that I finally found after a 20 year search!",1
The Regenerist hydration cream really does work. It made my face feel and look years younger. my skin was very smooth and I can even say I was glowing not literally but it made me feel a lot better about my appearance. That alone is worth the money. The product is very pricey but if you can scrap together the money it will help your over all appearance and make you feel good and smooth skin. To every one the best of luck to all that try this product out. It worked for me and it will work for you. hope this helps any one that wants to try this product out.

"It smells so good omg, it leaves your skin feeling smooth and rich. It gives your skin an indescribable glow.",1
"Love this stuff! Goes on smooth, doesn't feel greasy. It comes in a small jar but a little goes a long way, you only one little dab for each eye. I have used it mainly around my eyes for last few years. Trying to combat the crows feet and I do feel it is working.....and I am being realistic about results, absolutely nothing is going to eradicate the normal aging process short of plastic surgery. Try it!! You will like it! Skin feels hydrated! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
Love it this product is great and I plan on buying it over and over again. I recommend it to all skin types.,1
I have very dry skin and do to my age i have wrinkles. Regenerist deep hydration cream makes my face feel soft it also relaxes the deep wrinkles. I love this product I put it on at night and daytime under my makeup. I highly recommend this product.When you start using it and you see the results you will not purchase anything else. Your face will glow!!!!!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I started with the total effects and it worked wonders but as I got older I decided to try more intensive treatment. The Regenerist moisturizer is great. i have had people come up at work and say What kind of makeup if you do wear makeup do you use I have been told without makeup that my skin is translucent. The scent is so fresh and the cream seems to even my skin out without foundation, If you can at all, buy this and see how long it lasts and how much good it does. I don't think you will be disappointed.",1
Try the Olay products - there are levels according to your age and your skin care needs.,1
"I have always used Olay products, since I was in my 20's. I began to use the Olay Regenerist Microsculpting cream and Deep Hydration Cream in the past few years and the scowl line between my eyebrows was nearly gone. The lines around my eyes are visibly finer and my skin feels like velvet. People have commented how young I look. I am 60 years old and really, have only a minimal amount of wrinkles and I attribute that to the Olay products that I have used. My skin loves it. I won't use anything else. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I love this stuff it feels so creamy and rich Ive been using olay moisurizers since turning 18 Iam now 61 yrs old I'am always complemented on how nice my skin looks people tell me I certanly dont look my age ,I owe it all to olay I've tried other products and always go back to olay,you can see and feel the difference no overpowering fragrance absorbes into your skin leaving it feel so smooth and soft not greasy what so ever I think it helps make my foundation go on smoother love this majic creamyness This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I slowly added products from the Oil of Olay Regenerist line to my daily regimen. My skin was dry from many years of sunbathing and the wrinkles were really showing. The Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream really softens and hydrates the skin. I did not get instant results but after consulting with Oil of Olay on-line chat, I was told to allow the product to work for about six weeks. I stayed with it and have found that this cream under my makeup creates a lovely finish. And for a fair price too!",1
"Great product, would definitely recommend to a friend.",1
It works really good an i use it every day it make ur skin nice a soft an clear its just my favorite an it smells really great,1
This product is the best of the best for me and you. I love the way it is not the only way to get a new look,1
I have used this product for years and my skin is supple and has very few wrinkles. People constantly come up to me and comment on what lovely skin I have. I also have people commenting that I look 20 years younger than my actual age. I know my Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream has been a huge help in staying young looking. It is velvety and rich and my skin drinks it in. I love it! My foundation smooths on easily over my Hydrating Cream and my complexion has a dewy glow. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
Absolutely the best. Fresh scent not abrasive. Left my skin sing a song of six pents. Love it love it love,1
This product smells amazing because it's natural.p product is amazing due to quality.,1
"I use this both in the morning and at night. It is super creamy and disappears right into your skin, leaving it very soft. I apply my makeup right over it to ego the new day. I have been using this product since it was first introduced and feel that it has helped my skin age kindly. I recommend that you try it soon. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
It feels real good on my skin its very smooth smell really amazing,1
"Was persuaded to try this product because of the peptide vitamin B ingredients. The non-jar packaging was also a selling point. This is a very nice, light-weight cream, that absorbs quickly. It sits so lightly on my skin that I can't feel it and has an ever so slight pleasant scent that dissipates quickly. It does a nice job of moisturizing without resulting in unwanted shine. It's working well for both night-time and day-time use for my aging, sun damaged, somewhat reactive skin. In fact it seems to have a calming effect on my reactive areas. I've been trying many different moisturizers lately - high-end and drug-store brands - and so far this is the best.",1
"Great product for the deep South I would recommend this product for anyone. I have just turn 56 years young and I love it, so start young and watch what it will do for you as you grow.",1
Ive used olay because its good and helps the skin real good and ive recommend someone else to use it also yes its a good product,1
It works good because its fast i would recomend this product because itd good for your hair and it makes it soft and it smells good,1
"My mother gave this product to me and urged me to give it a try. I wasn't expecting anything to happen it was a present from Mom, and it was just another moisturizer - well, so I thought! One night I was brushing my teeth and I realized that the fine little lines above and on either side of my nose were a lot less noticeable. Then I got out the magnifying mirror and noticed that a lot of those other little creases and lines seemed shallower than before. Hate to say this, but once again, Mom was right. (BTW, love the creamy, mousse-ish texture of the product. It's not greasy at all and it feels so good when I smooth it on my face.) This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Thid product lraves your face feeling smooth, soft and clean.",1
Love the feel n results in one day. I did recomendable to my mom n we both use it daily. I also us under eye products and i am amazed on how effective it is. I shared this with my 18 year old son cause he has dark circles due to allergies. At first he thought it wouldnt work. To his suprise after a 72 hours woohooo it started working. I am very happy to be a loyal olay customer. Completely satisfied on my end. Thank you very much for asking.,1
ITS SUPER GOOD AND AMAZING I really like the packaging to I believe you should keep making this product and selling it was a little pricey but it was totally worth it.,1
Went on smooth I feel like I have a new skin after showering I applied on my face and throat areas,1
I have loved this since it came out.feels amazing and wipes away the dull and lifeless skin.,1
This product is amazing! It tends to be really hard for me to find products that works well. Olay really helps my skin a lot!,1
I just started using this product. I am in my 50's - other products either don't agree w/my skin or aren't as hydrating. I love this - I use it in the morning and then at night I use the Olay Microsculpting Serum and Cream. I'm very happy with the Olay Regenerist line!!,1
This is the best cream to use for your face before putting on your makeup! I rate it 5 stars!,0
Can't live without it is mine daily driver to having a good day,1
I love this product it really works leaving your skin soft n young looking.,1
Skin felt amazing After 2 hours my skin was will hydrated I Have my whole family using this product,1
"I like how i the product feels once it is placed into my skin, almost instantly relieving it and making it much smoother.",1
"I've been using Oil of Olay since I was around 18 or 19 years old, I'm 63 now. I love all the products I wouldn't use anything else. I have fantastic skin , for my age, almost no wrinkles! Actually, no one ever comes close to guessing my age! I strongly recommend any and/or all the Oil of Olay products!",1
it really helps because of the consistoncy and really moisturizes,1
This product is perfect! I use it on a daily basis. The moisturizer makes my skin feel soft and leaves a beautiful shine,1
You skin is 100 better thank u I will use it for ever and spread the word,1
This moisturizer has a tacky feel on the skin and it helps my foundation stay on all day,1
This product is incredible because it always feels like you are wearing it all over you but mainly your face. Thank you for making this product.,1
I have used this brand for over 15 years and I like the way it makes my skin feel and the price was fabulous compared to the price elsewhere,1
This product it's amazing because it makes your skin feel younger,1
This product smells amazing because it's good into skin I used this product almost 7 years now and I love the lotion for the face also,1

This product is nice with the skin because it smoothes it and my your skin look healthy,1
This product is amazing and I recommend this to all of my friends,1
Love the product. I use it every day and it keeps my skin glowing. I am very pleased with this olay product.,1
This product makes me feel so refreshed ... after using it for a few weeks I feel my skin is tighter and youth looking,1
It feels great on your skin.,1
My skin was so dry and damaged from the sun. Using this for 2 months I saw great results. I will never stop using this product it's been 5 months and still satisfied,1
"Effectiveness,price all worth for this product, I really like this for my aging dull skin,at my age it's hard to find a product that helps my skin get hydrated. My family saw a difference in my skin after use, I got lots of compliments about my skin on my face. You don't need to spend a lot of hard work to just apply, it works while I sleep and under make up. I felt price is reasonable and works great! I have tried more expensive cream for my face and was DISAPOINTED, untill I tried the Olay products I really love them. I also know they work!! I would recommend this products to all skin types, they have several products for every type of skin. Thank You So Very Much. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have tried many different types of moisturizers, but this product does a great job for me! Thanks Regeneration Oil of Olay",1
"I'm very pale and have somewhat irritable skin, so I am pleased that this moisturizer is so light and easy on my face. Great hydration. It's a bit thicker than some products, so it will take longer to absorb fully. The package technology is actually really cool. You push the whole top of the jar down, and a little bit of the cream comes up. It works something like a push-pop. You get just the right amount, and when you get to the last of it, all of the cream is pushed out so that there isn't any wasted being stuck inside the jar. Love that.",0
THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. MY SKIN IS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED! IT LIVES UP TO ITS PROMISES. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS I WISH IT HAD SPF ALREADY ADDED . i HAVE TO USE A SEPERATE PRODUCT WITH SUNBLOCK IN IT AS WELL. FOR THE PRICES OF THESE PRODUCTS AND THE WHOLE REGIMEN FOR THAT MATTER THERE SHOULD BE SOME SUNBLOCK ADDED . DONT GET ME WRONG THESE PRODUCTS ARE AWESOME!,0
I have tried many other products but Oil of Olay is the best. It is not oily or a heavy lotion my skin looks feels good.,0
"I can't believe how wonderful this product is. I have the driest skin in the world, nothing has really ever helped much. After one use my skin feels renewed, very silky and smooth, I feel like my face has been given a drink from the fountain of youth!!",1
I have used this facial cream for years and nothing else I have tried even comes close to this one. Love it.,0
"This is a wonderful moisturizer...and thats not the only thing Regenerist offers. It smooths age lines, crows feet, laugh lines and uneven skin tones.",1
Don't look my age. Skin looks great. Use product twice per day with super results. My older sister uses it too. She loves it. We both recommend it!,1
I obsessed with OLAY products can never get enough been using OLAY products since I was 14 year's old and I will be 28 in August. Keep up the Great work OLAY company.,1
"I've been using this product for a number of years now (I've lost count). People constantly tell me I look younger than I am, so I will continue to use it!",1
Use it every day it has made a profound difference,1
After applying for only a week I noticed a few of those hairline wrinkles around my eyes going back where they came from!,1
Us this for many years and love love love it. One of the best products Olay has!!!!,1
The results were fast. And it feels great on my skin. I would regiment it to anyone.,1
"No one knows my age, and are very surprised when I tell them!",1
"My girl Jan, Okay is the best for white and dark skin complexion.",1
"I'm 45, my skin is sensitive and very dry. I use Olay Regenerist Hydration Moisturizer, the Eye repair, I use the Olay foaming face wash. I saw the difference in my skin in less than a week. I love all the products, including the body wash, and after body wash lotion. Great line of products and great prices. Thanks!",1
great moisturizer for day or night. I use this all the time. Highly recommend for problem skin or sensitive skin. I suffer from psoriasis and during stress outbreaks I have used this on those spots.,0
I have used this product for a few years and love it. It provides great moisture and smells great too. My skin feels terrific,1
"Very soft powdery feel. Absorbs nicely. I really like this product, it doesn't feel sticky or oily on my skin.",1
Excellent product.,0
If i could posted picture's of both when i was 23 and now at 40 and ive been using olay from the age of 12years old love u for making this product..,1
"This is one of the creams that works on skin that is dry despite exfoliation. I am 60 and active so I have good skin and this cream helps to keep it in good condition. I use retinol (that is one of the reasons my skin gets dry) but use this cream every other night. For me, it works well as a night cream. I take a warm shower after exercise, rinse with cold to close the pores, and this cream is still absorbed. I like the ingredients. I have seen articles that reccomend some of the ingredients, which were written by dermatologists, and the price is more reasonable than department store brands who sell less product for more money and may not, in some cases, be in touch with the science of skin. I recommend it to younger and older friends because it works! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I love the lotion so much it helps me a lot my skin hasn't felt this good in a really long time and I am thankful to have such a good lotion to help me and my dry skin problems,1
"I just used this product for the first time and it is phenomenal! I have been combating dry, flaky skin due to topical acne medicine. I have been using another product that is also good - but it wasn't good enough. I read numerous reviews all over, and this came up repeatedly. I took the plunge and bought it - best decision I have made in a long time! I am enormously pleased!! Highly recommend to everyone. At 23-ish, that was a little steep for me, but it is well worth it.",1
The product was awesome becauseof the new cool and dry skin care products,1
"Leaves windows with streaks, although it does seem to work OK on other surfaces.",1
it leaves streaks bad . i used windsheild washer fluid in spray bottle to clean off windex. now clean!,1
Very disappointed in this product. It leaves all kinds of streaks no matter how many times you wash your windows. A 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water is much better.,1
"Windex used to be good years ago. Since they reformulated it, I will no longer buy it. It leaves a terrible film.",1
"Having used Windex for years , I noticed in the last year or so, a VERY different result when I clean my windows. I have had to go over them 2-3 times and still they have a streaky film not seen before. What's going on I have now resorted to light soap with a lemon water rinse and my windows sparkle. You have lost a very loyal customer and I am not alone, though I can now spend that money on lemons !",1
"Despite the long reputation this product has had as a top glass cleaner, it no longer gets the job done. Too often I find streaks and smudges appear on the mirrors within hours of cleaning. It doesn't matter if I use a paper towel, newspaper, or lint-free cloth. Windex's 'streak-free shine' is a false advertisement if you ask me. This is no longer my choice glass cleaner.",1
"I have used windex for many years (only because my family introduced me to the product) and always been unhappy with the film/streaks it leaves on the glass. I have to go back over it several times and i still can't get rid of the film/streaks. I use paper towels and even with cloth, streaks of film are left. I'm testing other products in order to find something better.",1
Why did they change the formula it's awful . I tried using this on my car windshield the other day and all it did was leave an oily film that smudges really bad also tried it on the bathroom mirror same results. guess it's time to go back to basics of vinegar and water. I've used windex for over forty years never had a problem with streaks or smudges.,1
I have yet to buy a glass cleaner that doesn't leave streaks and this one failed also. I have switched to plain water in a spray bottle for my mirrors and it is amazing how they shine. Try it. Better for the environment too.,1
"Windex used to be good years ago, the last couple of years it is terrible. After cleaning window three times there is still a film everywhere, looks terrible when the sun light shines on it. Will not be buying anymore.",1
"I've used Windex for 30 years and not sure what has changed but no doubt something to cut costs, increase profits. Definitely not the original cleaner. This product no longer works. Leaves streaks and film and no matter how much you apply or repeat clean, seems to only get worse! Finally used water which worked better. So frustrating.",1
I have used Windex for 30 years and now I am at a loss. In the last month I have been trying to use it on glass and it did nothing but leave streaks no matter what paper towel I used. I am very disappointed that they have taken a standard and ruined it. I will be changing products. Have no choice.,1
"I have used Windex original for over 50 years and have always loved it. Now I clean windows, mirrors and glass topped tables and have nothing but streaks. I thought it was my cloth so changed it to everyone available plus paper towels and still streaks. What did you do to my favorite glass cleaner",1
"I used all windex products for years. Now all the cleaners , not just windex, leave a smeary residue. I have tried newspaper, unprint newspaper for packing and many types of cleaning cloths, as well as paper towels. I noticed this happening about 2 years ago. What has happened to the formula.",1
"Have tried windex with a squeegee, microfiber cloth, newsprint, two different types of paper towel. No matter what I do, how many times I wash it, there are always gross streaks. In fact, it seems like every time I apply windex, the streaks get worse. I'm looking for another window cleaner.",1
Washed my car windows 4 times using different paper towels and lint free cloths. Could not get the windows clean. Ended up using ammonia and water and got most of the streaks off on the fifth time! I used Windex Complete and will never use it again. Streaked the bathroom mirrors too.,1
"This is the most useless product that Johnson Company ever produced. My dog licking on the surfaces will get things cleaner. Not only will it not clean, it streaks and does not clean at all. It is the biggest mistake that I have ever purchased.",1
"Cleaned my car, wash windows and then sprayed with windex not once three times streak streak streak then I had to rewash with vinegar to get the windex off . And no my car was not that dirty I was it once a week but ran out of my other window cleaner I won't do that again.",1
"I've used Windex all my life and while it's not streak-free, it did an adequate job. But lately, my windows are covered with a white haze in blotches. I have to go back over and over to get them clean. This is not the original Windex - what have you done to it",1
"Windex used to be the best but whatever they have done to the formula has now made it horrible. It leaves a film on all the windows, mirrors, and glass table tops. What happened Waste of my money. Will not buy and do not recommend.",1
"I have been using the Windex/Multisurface with vinegar for years and have always had very good results. I went looking for another bottle when I ran out and noticed that the packaging has changed. I purchased a bottle and also noticed another thing, the quality has changed as well. When I used it on my mirrors they were all smudged. I did not get that usual streak free shine that I usually get with this particular product. I have enjoyed using your Windex/Multisurface, vinegar product in the past and have always passed over the less expensive brands to purchase this particular product because I knew it's quality. If this is the product that you will be producing, I will no longer be a consumer. I understand that you have to find ways to keep things cost effective for your company as well as the consumers,but please maintain your quality.",1
"I've used this product for many years and was very happy with it. But in the last year I find it streaks and leaves a dull finish. At first I thought maybe it had froze during shipment, but then I repurchased it several times and it still not the same has it use to be. AND don't tell me I'm using it wrong or it's the operator because it is NOT. I've also read the reviews and I'm not the only one complaining about this product. I gave it a very low rating because I KNOW it use to be a good product. Something has changed whether it's the way it's produced or the ingredients. But I will not be purchasing any more of this. I can do better with vinegar and water and it's not has costly and I don't have to waste time trying to get it to not streak or dull up within a day or two..",1
I remember years ago that Windex used to be the go to product for clean car windows. Spray it on and wipe it off with no streaks. Not anymore. I don't know what you changed but I spent 15 minutes trying to clean my car windows and they are still streaked. It is so bad that I have to be careful driving tonight because the streaking causes so much glare. I will find something else tomorrow. You need to go back to the formula you had 25 years ago which worked as well as your commercials state now. I have tried some of the other Windex products and they are worse. Forget profits for once and make a quality product again!,1
"I used Windex Original on my glass top kitchen table and all I could see was a smeary haze. I tried it two more times and it was still hazy. The forth time instead of a paper towel I used a clean cotton dish rag - still smears. I had been cleaning both top and undersides of the table. When I tried windex on a nearby window, it seemed to work fine. I wonder if the previous cleaner had left a residual My husband who has more muscle is going to reclean the glass top bottom. If microfiber cloth is required,you should put that on the label. I clean my table 3 or 4 times a day - I NEED SOMETHING THAT WORKS.",1
"This product is no where near working successfully in cleaning windows. To my disappointment the home remedies that I had used before trying this worked 100 better. No matter how I approach the cleaning, it just leaves streaks and film. In years past Windex was used and it seemed to have worked better than the current bottle. Biggest disappointment is that I just bought a one gallon refill!",1
We have been using Windex for years and re-selling it in our store. Inn the past 6 months though we have found that cleaning a window with new paper towels and this product leave a translucent film that makes it look like the window hasn't been cleaned in years. I have personally used it from different bottles and had the same lousy results. It is like there is no ammonia at all in the product and it can no longer cut through whatever is on the windows. We heat with propane during the winter and that may have put the film on the windows but they used to come clean with Windex easily. Now they look worse than when I started!,1
"I just tried to clean normal interior film off the windshield of my wife's car. The result was some residual film after I tried to use this product twice. Based upon recent experience with Windex Original on other cars I own with the same poor results, I'm done using this product. This has been my go-to for years, but I give up! I don't care about cost, I'll find something that works the way Windex did in the past and I'll buy it.",1
I have been using Windex original consistently for the past 40 years. It did provide the performance I came to expect and rely on up until the past year or two. It now serves as nothing but frustration as it does not produce a streak free finish on glass or mirrors anymore. It seems to have lost its grease cutting ability and just provides endless streaking. I will be seeking other alternatives.,1
I have now purchased two different 23 oz bottles of the Windex Orignial within 4 weeks of each other. The spray trigger broke off on the first bottle after about 4 uses. I still had 80 of the bottle left. So I went and purchased a second 23 oz bottle with the intentions of switching out the tops so that I could use the rest of the first bottle. After one use (cleaned 4 windows and a mirrow) the trigger from the second bottle broke too. Now I am stuck with two almost completely full bottles of windex and no way to clean. I will be looking for a new brand...,1
"We've stuck to the Original for decades after something that was either called dripless or streak free left streaks. NOW, our bottle of Original Streak Free Shine with Ammonia-D left disheartening streaks on our glass coffe table and glass dining table. I finally got the streaks off by wiping carefully with water and removing the water beads carefully - making quite a task for me. - QUESTION: is what we bought truly the ORIGINAL or is it the original streak free Otherwise, why are we getting streaks",1
"I have used Windex for years, always wondering why I kept using it. I have never had a streak-free window, even after going over it multiple times. I have tried newspaper, paper towels, cloths, everything I can think of and still it leaves streaks. I just started cleaning my windows again. They are heavy to lift out. I cleaned my first window, checked again and cleaned again before putting it back in, Out comes the sun and shows up all the streaks. I guess I would rather have dirt windows, Never again will I use Windex!",1
"Like many others I have been using Windex for years and have been happy with it. Recently, however, it seems to be leaving a streaky film. I use the same kind of lint free cloth as ever so I can only conclude the formula has changed. I note that others are reporting the same problem with the film. Has the formula changed",1
"I have used Windex for over 35 years and have been happy for most of that time. While I don't know what changes Windex has recently made, I am severely, repeat severely, disappointed in Windex product offerings (including Windex Original and other newer versions of Windex). I am so disappointed that I have recently been making my own solution. It works significantly better than Windex.

"What happened to Windex I could work on my window for an hour still not get it clean. There's a film on the window you can see every swipe I made with the paper towel trying to clean the window. Back forth I went, inside then outside the window, over over again still it's streaky filmy. What's so annoying now is that it's on my windshield I have to look thru the streaks every time I drive. Does anyone know another product that works",1
I am 67 years old and windex is what I have always used as did my mother. I was so disappointed with the original windex. It left cloudy windows and did not smell like the original. I thought maybe you had changed the formula. I have since found that other woman have the same issues of cloudy windows. Was there an issue or is this what the product will continue to be I do not want to say goodbye. Thank you,1
I have many glass surfaces in my home and windex is a regular on my shopping list. The last bottle I purchased must be a different formula. Everything I use it on is a streaky mess. I actually made a quick store run to buy a different product when a friend text that she was stopping by. If the quality of this Johnson family product isn't restored they should discontinue it. Who has time for cleaning products that cause extra work!,1
"For year I used Windex and was satisfied. It performed no miracles but did an adequate job of cleaning glass tops and mirrors. In the past few years it does nothing but smudge anything I use it on. Today I used it on my Porsche windshield. What was I thinking Anything I put Windex on creates horrible smudges. It looks like the surface is oily. I have tried paper towels, micro fiber, newspaper and always the same awful result.",1
"I have used Windex in the original formula for many years. Always worked great. Now all I can find is Windex Complete. Aptly named, it is a complete failure. Does not clean car windows, nor other glass well. Leaves streaks that can only be minimised by immediately wiping with a dry paper towel, and even then cot completely. Give me back my original formula. I am currently searching for another product I am so disappointed.",1
"Lots of people have posed that same question in their reviews. Is there no answer forthcoming I've used Windex for years and never had such a problem with streaky windows as I do now. I cleaned one window 3 times today with poor results. Did you change the formula If so, I suggest you listen to your loyal customers and change it back PDQ!",1
"Used to work great, but now it's the worst product.",1
I have now purchased two different 23 oz bottles of the Windex Orignial within 4 weeks of each other. The spray trigger broke off on the first bottle after about 4 uses. I still had 80 of the bottle left. So I went and purchased a second 23 oz bottle with the intentions of switching out the tops so that I could use the rest of the first bottle. After one use (cleaned 4 windows and a mirrow) the trigger from the second bottle broke too. Now I am stuck with two almost completely full bottles of windex and no way to clean. I will be looking for a new brand...,1
"Twice now ever since they introduced the new sprayer bottle, after the very first couple quick squeezes the new flimsy squeezer snaps off, rendering the bottle useless.. these used to last forever and we would just buy bulk refills... is this some idea from some new guy hired to save money idea to make hem break easier so you buy more, oris it just shoddy design I've purchased a noname glass cleaner sprayer (it was cheaper than buying a new empty sprayer bottle) and will refill with windex left overs, then continue buying no name glass cleaner.... who cares how good it cleans if the sprayer breaks instantly... i am sure some new marketing guy got a bonus and a pat on the back for saving a few cents on a inferior spray nozzle",1
"I have been a faithful Windex user for over 40 years ... but the last couple of years I've noticed more and more that it does not clean like it used to. My mirrors were always sparkling clean, but now I have a film and streaks that will not come off. I even went back over them with a clean dry paper towel and there were faint blue smudges on the paper towel. That tells me that Windex is leaving a residue on the glass ... which leads to streaks .... which is frustrating. Recently remodeled the bathroom and we have lots of mirrors, but now they are a hot mess. Will be trying new cleaners - or using vinegar and water.",1
This stuff is the worst thing I have ever bought!!!!! My glass is worse now than when I started.,1
"Not sure what has happen to this Product, Leaves a scummy residue after glass has bee wiped.",1
"I have to agree with Mel. Used to be a great product. I am curious as to what the changes were that SC Johnson made to the product, that Heather refers to.",1
What the heck is going on with your product The Windex it self is good but the trigger keeps breaking off. I have broken 3 red plastic triggers in the same week. Not impressed.,1
30years of using windex and the last few purchases it seems as if it is watered down....something is different in the formula. The discount brands work far better...what happened,1
It does not work. the code is 19800702984 I have cleaned multiple time and got the same bad results.,1
New cap design - How tdo you put it in spray mode There are no mode indicators on the nozzle.,1
This is a great windex product that I came across after a long time.Please try once and then believe me.,1
I use to swear by windex and carried it with me everywhere. Now it seams the ingredients have changed. All it does is smudge. What happened,1
"Like so many other, I find that no matter what I do or how I use it, it leaves streaks on the windows. Been doing cleaning for over 50 years. Really not happy with it.",1
"I love Windex!!! Everyone who knows me knows this! However, you guys have messed up perfection. Stop messing up what is already good. Stop trying to cut cost...",1
This is a great windex product that I came across after a long time.Please try once and then believe me.,1
I have used Windex forever. The last couple of bottles have left streaks everywhere. Even the Windex that is sold on cloths in packages does this. (So I know it is not my paper towels). Has anything changed in the formula Could it just be Windex sold in California We have lots of regulations here prohibiting this and that. Please help. A couple of years ago I would have given the product an excellent review. Thank you!,1
"I have always used Windex and growing up so have my parents, but lately the mirrors have a cloudiness to them. I though it was because I bought the Ammonia-Free, so then I also bought the Original with Ammonia and it still leaves my mirrors cloudy. Not happy when I am cleaning my house before I have a open house in a few hours.",1
"Why was the sprayer nozzle changed It worked perfect the way it was, now the nozzle sticks in the down position. Takes too long to clean with this, I'll look for something different. I like Windex, but hate the new sprayer.",1
"Windex doesn't clean mirrors, glass like it used to. Leaves streaks. Works somewhat better than last brand tried so bought again. Got home and it won't spray. Nozzle front won't turn at all and nothing else works to open it. I shouldn't have to buy spray bottle for something that comes in a spray bottle.",1
Maybe i am picky but after cleaning i see a film and cloudy streaky result. I have used this product for many years and don't want to change if i don't have to. Mirrors and windows used to look like new but not lately.,1
I have used windex all of my life. I have 5 foot windows throughout my home and have always prided myself on the cleanliness of my windows. I purchased three bottles of this windex and everyone of my windows and mirrors have streaks that look as if my windows haven't been cleaned in months. What is the new ingredient in the Glass and More cleaner that is creating this. Maybe you should consider bottling a JUST GLASS CLEANER and stop trying to be everything to everyone. Two days of hard work down the drain and I don't know how to correct the problem. Help,1
"As so many of the other reviews have suggested, it definitely seems as though something has changed. I can't get it to stop streaking. I have used Windex for as long as I can remember for everything. I primarily use Windex original. I'm not exactly sure when I started having issues. Probably the last year or so. I tried changing paper towels and using a clean lint free rag with no improvement. It's been driving me crazy. No matter how many times I spray and wipe my mirrors, windows, appliances and our glass top tables there are still streaks. Disappointingly I'm going to start trying other product.",1
"I have used the Windex glass cleaner for years and year on various surfaces such as mirrors, windows and glass top dining table. But this time when I bought it, it is doing nothing but leaving streaks. My dining table looks dirty no matter how much I clean it and it is not making sense to me. Has something about the product changed or is it the particular bottle This was my go to and now I am having to go research other products. so disappointed",1
"Have the ingredients in Windex window cleaner been changed in the past few years I have used this product for years, but the last few bottles have left streaks on windows and mirrors. Haven't changed my paper towel brand. It used to take only one spray/swipe, now takes several and still leaves streaks. I'm looking for a better product. Disappointed that something has changed after all these years. Please return to the old formula.",1
It's Windex - still streaks. I still use it. Wish there was a better product. (Instead of the vinegar/water and newspaper - but it works.),1
Windex is a good cleaning product. We use it on multiple surfaces and for the most part it cleans. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
My experience with Windex is that the Windex with Vinegar cleans soapy glass (shower) better than the Ammonia-D variety. The problem is: Finding it... Vinegar being a mild acid removes soap (a mild base) better but you must remember that other ingredients in the soaps and detergents may alter your choice. Let us have both so we can choose or market the different formulas for uses for which each excels.,1
"I used Windex streak-free shine on the 6'x4' mirror above the sinks in my bathroom and it was covered in streaks when I was finished. I tried several types of paper towels and cloths, but inevitably I cleaned with the Windex and then I had to go back over the entire surface of the mirror with a clean dry rag or paper towel to wipe off the streaks.",1
YUP its windex alright did i mention its window cleaner,1
I have used WINDEX for over 40 years....always loved it! It never left streaks or white haze on my windows! NOW it does! What are you guys doing to my favorite cleaning product PLEASE bring back the old WINDEX!!!!!!!,1
"I've been using windex for years and pleased with results. However, in more recent years the product left my windows with a cloudy film. Then I read that paper towels were the culprit. I now use newspaper and my windows are clear. It should be noted on the bottle not to use paper towels.",1
"I've always thought Windex Blue was the very best, however the last few times I've used it on my bathroom mirror it DOES streak. I'm very disappointed and have to go over it time and time again. It cleans it but definitely streaks it as well. Have you changed the ingredients Any suggestions Thanks!",1
"I'm 64. I've used Windex since the early 1960s. Original Windex with Ammonia D (for distinguished) in the aerosol can was an outstanding product. Since then, Windex has been letting me down. I recently cleaned the inside of my car windshield and I had to do it three times to get what I thought was a streak-free shine. It looked good UNTIL I drove into the sun. WOW! The windshield, according to my wife, looks even worse than before I cleaned it. Not only is it extremely streaky, it is covered with large hazy patches. I will have to try and clean it again. I also cleaned some mirrors around the house. They look pretty good close up. But from across the room, they are all quite streaky. I am sad that the fine product I grew up with has become just another average window cleaner. I will now try to find a new product that will do what I was hopeful your new original formula would do but did not. After more than 50 years, I bid you farewell.",1
"I would prefer the windex with ammonia-D on the front of the bottle. The original is okay, but the ammonia-d is best.",1

"I have used Windex off and on for years and have found it to be superior over many others as a hard surface and glass cleaner. It will clean most any dirt off of nonporous surfaces, even some inks. I like to use it on my auto glass especially, there is some in my car now. Though it is not perfectly streak free it does leave a fine finish. Besides, I have a little secret to make it a bit more streak free.",1
"The Windex cleaner itself is a great Product ... BUT the Windex spray pumps fail regularly. It is so cheaply made with built-in obsolescence that even if you buy the bulk jugs for refilling them, there's a good chance you won't have a working spray pump to spray it with -- Until they fix IT and make the pumps with some predictable life expectancy -- You Take Your Chances ... GOOD LUCK!",1

"I bought a 99 cent spray bottle and filled it up with Windex so I can clean my windows, mirros, and glass shower doors. It works great! It leaves them all sparkling, clean, and clear. I took away 1 star because it smells awful! Thankfully, the smell doesn't linger. You only smell it as you spray, but after that, it fades away.",1
I've loved and used Windex for years. I'm a life-long pet owner and you can't own pets with the messes they make without owning Windex. It easily cleans paw and nose prints off of windows and glass it helps to clean up stray hair on all hard floor surfaces and it's absolutely necessary to clean up at messy feeding stations. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I have often tried cheaper brands or making my own window cleaner. I always go back to Windex. The spray bottle works great and is comfortable to hold. The products works great on windows and glass. I have used it on many surfaces in a pinch and it really does a nice job - even cutting grease on my stainless stove top. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I purchase the Windex all in one cleaner for outside windows and love it. However, I have not been able to find the replacement pads in our area. I have looked at Walmart and they do not have them in the Toccoa store. Please tell me where I can find them without having to drive 30 or more miles. Ms. Weeze",1
"We prefer the original Windex with Ammonia D and this gives us a larger volume of it to fill all our spray bottles at a lower price. For those who already have the spray bottles, this can save you a few quarters, and stores in a smaller area than 4 extra spray bottles.",1
"I have used this product for probably 30 years and I have consistently had good results. Spray and wipe, I know it will clean. I have control over the amount of cleaner I spray and the sprayer is usually very good at shooting evenly where I want the cleaner to go.",1
"No matter how many new products come on the market, Windex has always worked very well for my cleaning needs. Especially on my mirrors and glass surfaces. I don't have to worry about streaks and the pleasant fragrance makes the room smell fresh and clean. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"The old windex bottle was smaller and the the sprayer that you pushed down on, instead of the trigger type sprayer of today, was more comfortable, much easier to use and sprayed more consistently in all positions. I miss it and wish they still made it.",1
"good stuff, decent price.",0
"Having used Windex on mirrors and windows with great success, I decided they would make my wine glasses sparkle ... which they did, Some friends were over the other night, and when they heard I had done this, they literally pored their wine in the sink. There is no warning on the label, and nothing on the web about this. If properly rinsed and dried after spraying, is there a problem with using Windex to make expensive wine glasses sparkle",1
"I use this product a lot at a care facility somewhere in California, because it works really well. I take turns using it with my friends. Thumbs up for volunteers everywhere.",1
"Consistent product , easy to use, light fragrance. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"26 FlOz Original BarCode 19800 70344, Lot P243T 17:16 Don't know if this is a recent design change in the pump or a defective product. When pulling the trigger, it sprays but the trigger does not return properly, and have to wait about 2 seconds to spray again, so a multiple spray is frustratingly slow when doing 15 windows inside and out. I also notice many bubbles in the top of the bottle - maybe because of a defect in the pump. I'd try for the money back guarantee - but of course bought the bottle about 3 weeks ago and don't have the receipt",1
Good,0
"Instead of buying a new bottle of windex every time, it's nice to be able to keep the old bottles just buy the refill. It's a good price for the refill as well. You get 2-1/2 regular squirt bottles in one refill bottle!",0

more than windows!,1
Dries clear and is easy to use if you have a container to refill.,1

I confess I once tried a different brand of glass cleaner because it was on sale (actually a buy one/get one free deal). I was very disappointed in that product - it left streaks and there was no shine. I had to go over everything I thought I had cleaned all over again - but this time around I used Windex. It's the only glass cleaner we use because it's the best. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I have tried many different glass cleaners, but never found one that works as well as Original Windex. Even the Windex Multiservice product does not clean glass as well as Original Windex. In particular. no streaks whatsoever. I am extremely pleased with this product and encourage Johnson and Johnson to continue manufacturing Original Windex. Thanks for listening.",1
"Who thought an old friend would really be the best cleaner for hearth and entry way tile Cleaning up window cloths from the hearth tile with a quick swipe at dust showed this to be true. So, a little spritz and a little wait before wiping dry and well, voila! Really clean! Off to buy more, a larger size and to toss other glass cleaners that I've used in-between.",1
"We have a glass cooktop and the wife always buys cheap cleaning spray at the dollar store which doesn't work very well at all, smearming the dirt and grease, I purchased Windex to use and found that it cut the grease very well along with leaving a nice clean shine. Thanks JJ",1
"At Maid 2 Glimmer we find that this is a great product all around the house. It even works great on painted surfaces like doors, trim and window sills.",1
"i feel ike windex is synonymous with window cleaner - it's literally the only brand I buy. typically I only use it on mirrors and windows. I used the windex touch up on my bathroom fixtures and they looked amazing compared to a cleaning wipe, so I am branching out on what I typically use windex to clean. there is always something that needs cleaning! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
By far the lowest price for an excellent brand - Windex.,1
"It works as good as it always has. It is probably operator error. When cleaning mirrors or gleasswork, Use a squeegee and unger. When polishing, mist a hint on a piece of rolltowel and wipe in long strokes in the same direction. Works just fine. Most people that think they know how to clean really don't!",1
"I absolutely love Windex as a multi-purpose cleaner. Less to buy, less to carry thru the house-one product that is available at all stores I shop.Great job on windows and glass. Even used it on my counter-top in the kitchen for a quick shine. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I use Windex on all my surfaces I just have one question is it safe to use on kitchen tables with young children,1
Great product,1
"Have used windex for years and years now and I don't have one complaint. Some say it streaks, well if your windows are really dirty the first time they will streak just do it again and the streaks and excess dirt will disappear.",1
I've been using this product for 40+ years and its an exceptional cleaner without leaving streaks...can't say enough about this product,1
"I will never used another off-brand window cleaner in my life. Not only does Windex do a phenomenal job cleaning all surfaces, but it doesn't leave a streak on my mirrors or windows. Competitors just cant seem to get it right.",1
"I received a free sample of Windex and have used it on windows, mirrors, kitchen appliances and my kitchen granite counters and tile back splash and have been very pleased with how well it cleans and shines these surfaces. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I first tried on bathroom mirror and was very impressed about the streak free clean surface. I further took advantage of this property by now using WIndex on my granite countertops. Very usful not just for glass surfaces. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I was very excited to get my free bottle, as I was just about to clean house for all of the out of town family/friends attending my daughter's wedding. Windex did the job, just as I expected, and made my surfaces shine! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
Use Windex for years .. every once in a while I go with the cheaper brands then realize why I kept with Windex all the years it is a far better product and worth the few cents more if you want the job done right . This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1

"Windex is a cleaning staple in our home. It is a classic! Windex works every time, on many surfaces and with very little effort. I keep a bottle under each bathroom sink, and in the kitchen for quick clean ups. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
Windex is a great common household product I myself like the refill bottle because it is almost the same price of the bottle and is 2x the size!! Love Love Love Windex also it was a cinch to pick it up in Store!!,1
I am a house keeper and Windex has helped me out many times. Have a problem getting hair spray off of the counters just sprayed Windex let it sit then wipe it up. Nothing compares to what windex can do. THANK YOU,1
I have tried all the others and always come back to Windex. I have even mixed my own because my friends have told me how good their home made kinds have worked. None of them have come close to good old Windex. My Sun Room has sixteen 6 ft. windows and we have a propane fireplace. It even takes the film off the glass.,1
"Before you clean anything ask the question Is it OK if my cleaner leaves a residue If the answer is No, then consider using Windex. They must use distilled or a very pure water because if you try clean a window even with ordinary tap water you will get streaks in most locales. I also LOVE that only Greenlist ingredients are used.",1
I just would like you to know that i ve been using Windex for over 40 years there isn't a day that goes by that i don't use it. I should own stock for it. I am addicted to Windex.. No other product like it.. i now am going to try the Windex in the green sprayer for my windows that i cannot reach in my home.. hope it doesnt streak,1
"Windex is my go to cleaner for mirrors and windows. I like the smell, but I love that it leave a streak free shine all the time. I have tried many other cleaners before and they do not work as well as Windex. It's worth all the money I spend on it. It not only works well on glass and mirrors but on other surfaces too. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have been using Windex for over 40 years. I will not use any other brand. It works great on all glass surfaces - windows, mirrors, etc. But it also works great on stainless steel appliances too! This is great because I don't have to buy anything extra. It will be in my home for another 40 years- if I live that long!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I have been a faithful Windex user as far back as I can remember. I use Windex to clean everything from glass shower doors to my glass stove top. Also works great on my marble tables and leaves a wonderful shine! I always receive compliments on how clean and shiny everything in my house is... I owe it to Windex! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I thought I wrote a review already, but will do it again if you want. I've been using Windex for over 42 years and will always use it. It works great. The best part is that it can be used on multiple surfaces. Glass, counter tops, stainless steel, etc. It always cleans wonderfully and never leaves a streak. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Windex has been a staple in my cleaning supplies for as long as I can remember, It is my go to product for cleaning glass and mirrors. I also use it when I am in a hurry to clean sink faucets.

I cant remenber a time that Windex wasnt in my mothers house. I started buying it and although I have tried other products I keep coming back to windex. It leaves a shine and no streaks. It cleans multiple surfaces and the price is right.I cant imagine any product that does more than windex. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I like to have bulk items like this delivered to my door. I usually place a big order of paper towels, tissues, and refills like this in one big order so there are no shipping charges. It's easier than lugging them home from the store. Products arrive on schedule and as promised.",1
Your free sample arrived just days before we closed on a lake house that had lots of dirty grimy windows inside and out (over 70 years old). Windex works wonderfully and streak-free on the dirt. The squirt handle was comfortable and now all 39 casement windows are shiny and bright. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I've tried other glass cleaners and none compare to Windex. Even if other cleaners are a few cents cheaper, they lack in quality...so I will gladly pay a little bit more for better results. Windex cleans well with no streaking. I use it on glass as well as other surfaces.",1
Had a new storm door to try it on. Took the sticky off the window from the sticker that always comes on new doors. Plus it cleaned the rest with no effort. While I was working on the storm door I also gave our other door a going over as well. Worked great there also This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
This is a wonderful product because it works so well on so many different surfaces. You don have to buy multiple types of cleaners because Windex does so many. It cuts through crease in the kitchen and film in the bathroom. I always start my cleaning with Windex.,1
"This product is amazing. I clean my clothes, bathroom, and kitchen with it. I even shower with it! It is so great. This product has been in my family for generations and it has never let me down. Everyone go buy this product now before I hurt you!!! Thanks :)",1
"Not only is it great for hard smooth surfaces, it removes stains from the carpet and upholstered furniture. It is great for the inside of the car. I keep one in the kitchen, one in each bathroom, and also with the car cleaning supplies. Can't live without it.",1
I use windex on everything and anything I can use it for. I have 3 bathrooms and I can tell you that there is a bottle in each with a roll of paper towels for those quick minute cleaning times that I reach for the Windex and give the baths a quick shine.

"No matter how messy car windows and rear-view mirrors are with weather, soot or bird stuff, Windex gets it right off and leaves them perfectly clear and shiny! The same is true on all house windows, where Windex is dependable for streak-free finishes! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Windex Original is the only glass cleaner I've ever used that leaves no streaks on windows and/or mirrors. I highly recommend it for auto glass cleaning as well as kitchen/bathroom counters, faucets, etc. It leaves a nice clean finish! Love it!!!",1
not having a car is hard enough but to wash windows and other items without windex is unbearable ... but with the refill I can always make sure I have what I need at home. I will buy more just to store ... its just wise...that's all,1
Been using this product for years and will continue using it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I occasionally fry food in my home but have unfortunately not yet conquered heating the oil correctly without it popping sending splatters all over my stove as well as the ceramic tiles behind it, the wooden cupboards above it, the refrigerator next to it and the surrounding walls and ceiling. In the past I have tried every grease fighting product I've seen advertised.They have ALL fallen short! Tonight is the LAST time I grab my Windex bottle as a last result! It has time and time again proven to be the ONLY cleaning product that actually works on dissolving and cutting through grease spots! Funny thing is though, I've never even tried any of the new Windex products,....the Original Glass Cleaner does the job all on it's own! I'm sold and will never spend another penny on any other grease fighting product!",1
I purchased a Windex refill because I no longer found the GV brand. Your brand performs just as good and was very much lower in price. I would have preferred the Walmart product.,0
My wife refuses to use anything but Windex.,1
"I have used Windex for years ,,,,, (decades) and it is the very best. In my view, one of the toughest jobs for any cleaner is getting car windows really clear and streak free. A film develops from multiple sources, .... some say from evaporating chemicals in the fabrics and plastics... who knows it seems to comes from nowhere. I have had great success when preparing windows for a car show using clean, new, white T-shirts and Windex. I soak the first one with Windex until almost dripping and go over every square inch thoroughly. Then a second new, clean T-shirt to dry and polish. Great success! Never use T-shirts, micro fiber cloths etc. that have been previously used with wax. The wax never completely washes out and ruins the window cleaning job.",1
"I mix it with water in a Zep sprayer bottle. My washer on mah pickumup truck don't work none, so when I gets the bug guts all over the windshield, I sprays it down real goods, wait a few seconds then turn on the wipers. It usually washes most of dem bug guts of'en the windshield. Some time though I have to use another dose. Sometimes though too, I use the Wallyworld product though it seems to work about as good.",0
I thought the price was a little high until I filled the spray bottle and now I know its a good value it will fill around 3 bottles plus some. Cheaper versions don't do the same job.,1
"In the past few years I had a mother, 3 brothers, that past away. I adopted a niece and a nephew, One of my biological kids got diagnosed with severe depression. On March 14 of this year I had a hearth attach. I work full time as a Microbiologist Scientist. One day at the grocery store I notice a Limited Edition of Windex. On the label it was printed Windex Happiness just a spray away! I got it immediately. Since then It has been my special friend every time I use it and when I use it, it makes me happy. I love my Windex happiness just a spray away. I need you to keep labeling Windex this way. I need my happiness to be just a spray away. I can't find any of them anymore.",1

No excessive energy used to keeping the car windows clean. My wife uses it for the home. What else: Windows and counter tops plus.,1
Windex I have to say really out shines anything other product I have ever used. This is one product for all my needs. I have use Windex for many years. I use it to clean the out side of my car. It does not hurt the paint finish by any means. In fact it makes my car sparkle. I use paper towels and Windex and my car is done. I use it for the hubcaps and it cuts the grease fast. The only way you'll know is to try it. Best of luck to all. 007,1
Windex is the best! I even clean the top of my stove with Windex. it shines it so nice!,1
I love how our windows and mirrors look after being cleaned with windex! ),1
"I am currently a college student who lives in a house that is known for having parties. Because of this every weekend we have major cleanup to do usually on Sundays. My go to cleaning product and possibly the only one my roommates and I use is Windex or Pledge. It gets our house back to looking good, at least for a college house with a bunch of boys living in it, before the Sunday morning football games start and we aren't early risers. It is the greatest thing ever it gets everything up for us. We love it thank you for creating such greatness.",1

"When I found this site, there were a lot of prior reviews complaining bitterly that the new Windows was inferior to the old and left hard to remove streaks. I find it hard to believe that people are that incredibly inept and impatient and have to assume that it was in some way the fault of Windex. Be that as it may, I bought another industrial sized Windex Advanced from Costco recently and after using it on the windows of my car, outside and inside, I am relieved that you seem to have listened to the on-line complaints and fixed the problem. This version of Windex not only sprayed well but, when used as recommended, with perhaps a bit of extra elbow grease as needed, actually cleaned the inside and outside glass surfaces and left them sparkling. Thanks again for fixing my favorite window cleaning solution.",1

"Not being a Kind Bar aficionado, I didn't know how widely different each type of Kind Bar is...I expected the same full flavor and fulfillment of the long thin Kind Bars. These are flat, square and rather bland. The dark chocolate adds some flavor but still nothing I was excited about. They do the trick in keeping hunger at bay, but they are not what I expected.",1
They're so hard and dry. They fall into a thousand peices when eating. And I wish they had more dark chocolate tast,1
The only reason I gave them a 4 star instead of a 5 is the oatmeal taste --simple ingredients you know and can pronounce and this bar is very handy when you are On the go and wish to eat something good for you!,1
I love this product. It's hard to find so I have to purchase it online. Great price.,0
Excellent Product!,0
"I thought the flavor and texture were very good. My 6 year old kept saying how much she liked the first one she tried, and then she ate another one right away. My 2 year old ate his pretty quick as well. Usually Kind Bars are 1-2 each, so this is a great value...I will be buying more for sure!",0
"This product is absolutely amazing!! After reading the ingredients I was skeptical about the taste, once I ate one I was hooked!! They are so delicious that my extremely picky husband enjoys them as well! I have turned some of my coworkers onto this tasty snack.",0
"Love the kind bars for being organic, gluten free and gmo free. Some of the bars do taste slightly sweet, but that's just to my taste.",0
Great snack and satisfies a taste for chocolate.,0
Love these. Non GMO and gluten free. They also taste great. Just the thing to go with that morning cup of coffee.,1
"I am absolutely terrible at eating a healthy diet. On one of my attempts to do this I tried these bars. They are delicious! Just the right amount of sweetness, crunch and of course plenty of chocolate chunks. I highly recommend these if you want to 'accidentally' eat a healthy snack.",1
"Very filling, and taste great. Kind of heavy, but they last!",1
"Kind bars make great on-the-go snacks! I'm a health conscious mom who reads labels and tries to steer clear of high fructose corn syrup, high sugar content, and refined flour. With kind bars, I don't have to worry about any of those things. Not to mention the delicious flavor they come in. I'm glad Walmart carries these bars!",1
These are very good if you're wanting a little bit of chocolate and you don't want to feel bad about eating it. :),1
I eat these when I want something a little sweet during the day. I love that they are made with healthy grains.,1
Healthy snack. Tasted great.,1
"I like the color protection part, however my hair feels weighed down after using. Prefer the volume shampoo for fine hair.",1
I like this improved version better than the old one which I didn't like at all. My hair feels very soft and appears a little fuller. The scent is pleasant - different than old version but is an improvement as well.,1
I recently got my hair dyed after many years of going without . Pantene was my shampoo of choice after gettibg my hair done. It has retained its luster for weeks since I got my new look. I will stay loyal to pantene products after seeing its results.,1
This product is good and I am happy with it. I will use it again and would recommend it to others.,1
This shampoo works and smells great. I use it everyday. Thanks,1
I love this Shampoo/Conditioner. I use it everyday on my color treated hair. It doesn't make your hair greasy or oily feeling like most other brands do. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who colors their hair. Its amazing and I will NEVER buy another brand again!! Thank you Pantene for being so wonderful :),1
"I love almost ALL your shampoos but this is my favorite. It delivers clean hair, shine, weightless conditioning, and a very clean fragrance. The lather is amazing and it rinses clean even in hard water. I love the Classic Clean and the other color safe formula for shine. LOVE!",1
"I received a sample of both the shampoo and conditioner and was very impressed. I bought them right away and have only been using these two products together for less than one week and I love them! My long hair feels so soft, is shiny, and not weighed down.",1
Most shampoos and conditioners for colored hair are so heavy that my hair just fell flat. With this new Pantene my color isn't fading and I have all day volume. Add the super reasonable price and I am one happy girl!,1
One of my favorite Pantene products. The product is rich and smells wonderful. It helps protect my colored hair without heavy buildup and gives my fine hair volume.,1
I love this product because it does EXACTLY what it says it will do ! My color remains beautiful and fresh and my hair feels luxurious and the volume sensational. Definitely recommend :),1
"My friend got this shampoo and conditioner for me and it worked great, kept my hair clean, hydrated and actually helped keep my hair died red for over two months!",1
"I decided to try color preserve when my color was fading. My color lasted longer and I like the smooth, silkiness of the shampoo.",1
"love the way my color lasted, shined had more volume than usual after I used Color Preserve Volume Shampoo.",1
It is absolutly weightless!!! I didnt understand that untill i tried it then i was lk aaaaahhhhhh!!,1
This product helped give my hair volume and kept my color looking new longer than anything else has!,1
This product creates awesome body to the hair. A must for flat heads,1
Pantene Color Preserve helps keep your hair color longer!,1
"I have very oily, fine hair and this shampoo just made my hair look dirtier than before washing it. My hair was greasy and heavy. I thought maybe I just didn't rinse well enough so I gave it another try a few days later but had the same results. I can say that it smelled good!",0
I've used your volume product for years but all of the sudden you removed the 2-in-1 so I switched to this and the conditioner then you changed the shampoo and the conditioner (which wasn't nearly as good as the 2-in-1 but was better than nothing) ! I loved your product but now I have to find another unfortunately nothing you offer compares to the quality you used to have! Why would you change such a great product! I wish you'd bring back the 2-in-1! For me being a man with baby fine hair it was the only product on the market that didn't cause me to lose hair or dry it out and didn't have an over powering feminine scent! I really wish you'd stop messing with good things!,1
I have been using aussome volume for over 10 years except it used to be called real volume. I would really like to know if you changed the formula for it. The last 6 or so months I've been having scalp problems with sores and my hair falling out. The last couple of bottles I purchased have had a much stronger smell to it and it is drying my hair and scalp out really bad. It never used to do this. It always made my hair really thicker looking and just really nice. Hardly ever had to use conditioner. Please if you could let me know about that I would really appreciate it. I haven't ever thought about switching from Aussie but now I think I have too.,1
"i tried this hoping it would give great results. it was the opposite effect. my hair became limp, flat, and greasy not to mention it felt grimy and dirty. i usually like these products but was diappointed. sorry aussie:(",1
IT LEAVES MY HAIR AND SCALP DRIED OUT. IT DOES PROVIDE ANY VOLUME.,1
"You changed the smell! The bottle I just used up says the scent is white ginger, the new one says it's jojoba, but it smells like cherries or something. Why in the world have you changed the formula! I've used this for over 10 years, and the smell was always the same, even if the formula was changed. I miss the old smell, it was my favorite. Now I have to find another shampoo with a mild scent that I like. Rude.",1
"The scent is too strong, it burns your eyes, and leaves your hair very dry. Avoid it. When it comes to shampoo and conditioner you really get what you pay for.",1
"I received this as a sample from influenster. First, let me say I love the smell. It is fresh and fruity and very good. However, when I was rinsing it out, it took all the 'slip' out of my hair and my hair felt pure straw!!! I am sad, because I loved the smell.",1
"I use this because it has very little fragrance, but the containers are pure torture to use. You can barely open and close them, so I have to put it in another bottle.",1
"I received this product free for testing purposes, but my opinions are 100 my own. I didn't fall in love with this shampoo. I think it dried out my hair. Once I rinsed it out, I instantly felt like I needed a lot of conditioner to make up for the dryness. I think there are better shampoos at the drugstore, but I didn't hate it.",1
This shampoo smells great and does a good job at cleaning my hair. I've been using this product for about 2-3 weeks. However I do not notice a difference in the volume of my hair. I have thick coarse hair which is hard to hold any volume even with teasing. If you have less coarse hair this might work better for you. I used this with their volumizing conditioner and spray and did not see a difference. I received this product for free but all opinions are my own,1
I do not feel like I had more volume after using this. Which is the whole point right I also could not stand the smell. That is just preference of course. But I was self conscious about it. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad shampoo but I didn't see a difference in volume. It did not make my hair worse. I did recieve this shampoo for free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.,1
"I was very disappointed with this shampoo. It didnt give me any volume. In fact it made my hair oily and flat. I lile aussir products but this one just doesn't hold up. I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.",1
"I use this because it has very little fragrance, but the containers are pure torture to use. You can barely open and close them, so I have to put it in another bottle.",1
"Makes my hair clean, soft, and smooth without weighing it down! Touchable volume and silky finish. It also smells so good. I was sent this product for reviewing purposes but all opinions are my own.",1
I thought this shampoo was great it felt good in my hair it didn't dry my hair out or make it overly oily. however the smell was a little strong for me it did smell good just alittle strong that's my only dislike. However if smell really doesn't bother you then you'll love this shampoo. I was given this product to try and review by influencer. However my opinion of the product is my own.,1
"I received this item for free and in my opinion I would love to use this product everyday! It is wonderful, the shampoo lathers really well and has a light citrusy scent. The conditioner is not greasy and I did notice that after a week of daily use that my hair does seem much thicker then usual! I would definitely buy this again.",1
"I love this shampoo so much! It leaves my hair feeling extra soft and lightweight! I do not see a difference with the volume in my hair after using this - that's why I gave this product 4 out of 5. Otherwise, I absolutely love this product so much and will repurchase! *I received this product via Influenster to try for free review",1
"This product is pretty good, but it's not really right for me. It doesn't make my hair as smooth as some other products I use, but that doesn't mean it couldn't do that for yours. It'd like it to provide a little more volume for what it's advertising. I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own.",1
"My initial reaction was that the bottle was very hard to open and that the scent was not all that great. However, after using it, I loved the way it made my hair feel. It felt soft and the difference in volume from my regular shampoo was noticeable. I received this product for free. Opinions are my own.",1
"So, i like this product because it tends to make my hair a little more dry and for me that is good up top because my hair gets very greasy very quickly. However because of this my hair gets more tangled than usual.",1
"I love this shampoo. I have extremely thick hair but this shampoo lathers up nicely and I an use less than I normally would. It doesn't weigh my hair down like other shampoos either. Like all Aussie products, the smell is fantastic and lasts all day. I tried Aussie for free but these are my own opinions",1
I loved this shampoo. Ive always loved aussie especially the smell of it. This shampoo is light i have thin staright hair and in always worried anything that promises volume will weigh it down but it left my hair bouncy and soft. I got this product for free but will purchase once i run out because i loved it,1
"I was given this product to rest for free from Influenster but alll opinions are my own. I liked this shampoo for the value and smell, but I didn't find it particularly volumizing. I have fairly flat hair so it takes a lot to work volume on me.",1
"Light, refreshing, and foamy - this shampoo really does a great job cleaning hair without leaving it heavy or stripped. Lots of foam, and lots of volume! I didn't like the packaging, but I did like the shampoo. I received this to review - but my opinions are my own",1
"I'm a fan of this shampoo. The fragrance wasn't overpowering and the thickness of it was good quality. A little of it goes a long way. I have very long way so this is a huge factor for me. It washed very well. As for added volume, there was some slight addition after a couple washes along with the conditioner. I did however, feel like the shampoo stripped a lot of the (good) oils from my hair and it felt dry before conditioning. So I needed to add extra to put the moisture back in. I received this product to review, but the review is completely my own.",1
"My boyfriend and I have both been using this shampoo and we both love it. He has thick hair and doesn't really need to use it at all, but I have really thin hair that tends to just sit flat on my head, especially at the roots. This shampoo smells wonderful and gives me volume all day long. I use it second in my routine....condition first, then shampoo. The ONLY con I have found with it is that it makes my hair stick together when I rinse it out and super hard to brush. Other than that, love it. Disclaimer: I tested this Aussie product for free, but all opinions are my own.",1
"I loved the smell and usually really enjoy Aussie products. My hair is dyed and it did seem to strip the color quickly so I'd prefer a more color friendly option. As far as the volume, I saw no difference in this shampoo and any other shampoo I've ever used. Combined with other products or worked nicely. I received this product for free to review in exchange for my opinions.",1
"I am absolutely in love with this Aussie Aussome shampoo. I have been using it for a little over a week and my hair is visibly shinier, and smooth to the point where I can run my fingers through it and there isn't a single tangle.This leaves my hair feeling really clean, but also really smooth and shiny. This is also a pretty good deal. I recommend using it with the Aussome Conditioner. I received this product for free to review from influenster for testing purposes.",1
"This shampoo made my hair super soft and smooth, and did give it volume. Plus, it smells great! A little bit goes a long way. It's super sudsy, which leads me to the downside. It contains sulfates, and I try to stay away from shampoos containing sulfates. I guess the other thing that was a con was that it's a bit difficult to open the lid when you're in the shower. It can be a bit hard to open. (Disclaimer: I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.)",1
"I really liked this shampoo, it smells great and it added a little bit of extra volume to my hair. There's only one problem - the shampoo bottle is hard to open. Disclaimer: I received this product for free in an Aussie VoxBox from influenster, but all my opinions are my own.",1
This shampoo feels very lathering on the hair. It really foams up so a little goes a long way. My hair feels clean right after I use it. It has a very fruity smell and the closest that I can compare it to is skittles. The only thing is that this precept doesn't give me the volume that I am looking for or that I was expecting. I will be using other Aussie products just not this one in particular. I did try this product for free but all opinions are my own.,1
The product is great. Cleans and adds volume to hair without weighing it down.,1
Enjoyed it,1
what is the fragrance is it lavender smells like it but ingredients don't say thanks,1
"My husband, two year old daughter and I all used this shampoo and conditioner with no complaints. Left my hair feeling soft and clean. I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.",1
Loved this shampoo! It's lathering and smells great! It's perfect for limp or flat hair and really helps boost up the volume when used more and more. Thanks Aussie!!!,1
I really like this shampoo! It smelled great and seemed to really work with my hair! But if you are looking for moisture this is not for you.,1
"Lathers well, smells great, cleans thoroughly, inexpensive, removes buildup. Highly recommend. I think it's more of a clarifying shampoo, which I love because nothing makes hair meaner than leftover styling products. I also think, quite frankly, the little kangaroo on the bottle is adorable, not that I only use shampoo endorsed by marsupials. Cheers.",1
"I had to take off one star because of the bottle design for the 13.5oz bottle. Though it is unique, the cap is very tight and super hard to open - I thought it was just me, but upon asking my friends and family that also use this product, they, too, agreed that the cap is too tight and difficult to open. (Especially if you have nails - be super careful, as I have already broken two nails opening this product). It's a shame because the product itself is wonderful - smells great, works great, delivers perfect oomph and volume to your hair, leaves it wonderfully lightly scented, decent price, and is an overall great product. I ended up simply prying the cap open before I go to use the shampoo/conditioner, and pouring it into an empty bottle from another shampoo brand. I would love if a new cap design/technology was looked into for a smoother, easier opening!",1
"I love this shampoo so much! It leaves my hair feeling extra soft and lightweight! I do not see a difference with the volume in my hair after using this - that's why I gave this product 4 out of 5. Otherwise, I absolutely love this product so much and will repurchase! *I received this product via Influenster to try for free review",1
"I have used this product (along with the aussome volume conditioner and hairspray) for the past 2 weeks, and I love it! I have gotten so many compliments on the shine and volume of my hair since I have used this product! It's a great price and a great set to use if volume and shine are what you're looking for. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future! While I did receive this product for free to test, all of these opinions are my own.",0
"I am a huge fan of this shampoo. I love the scent and it leaves my hair feeling clean. I paired it with the conditioner and my hair feels alive. I highly recommend this product. I was selected to test Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.",1
"My wife has been using Aussie for years. First attempt at this type, likes it very much. She claims that it adds shine and fullness.",0
I have received this product for free for review but it I always state my true and honest opinion! This shampoo has been great for me. It smells so delicious!!! It doesn't dry my hair and leave it knotty like other shampoos. After showering my hair absolutely feels nice and does have a little volume.,1
"I love the smell of this Aussie shampoo. It gets my hair very clean without drying it out. I love how soft my hair feels after using this. I have fine hair, and i did notice a bit of volume after using this shampoo. I received this Aussie product for free in an Influenster Voxbox for testing purposes. My opinions are completely my own! :)",1
"I use this shampoo once every other day in the shower. The smell is nice and the shampoo foams up great! I use Aussome Volume Conditioner as well and wake up with great, volumized hair. I even had a friend comment on how much body I had. I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.",1
I was very impressed with the clean feeling this shampoo gave my hair after using it. It has a nice scent and when combined with awesome volume conditioner (which I did) leaves hair with a tremendous amount of body and shine. I received this product for free and these opinions are my own.,1
I love the smell of this shampoo. Plus my hair feels so soft side I have started using it. Using this with other products of the Volume collecting I can tell a difference. I received this Aussie product for free in an Influenster Voxbox for testing purposes. My opinions are completely my own!,1
Very pleased with this product! I paired this with the Aussie Volume Conditioner. I have very fine straight hair so it definitely helped me to achieve volume when scrunching my hair! Would recommend. I tried Aussie for free and my opinions are my own.,1
"I love having big, bouncy, full of volume hair, especially when I curl it. My favorite quality of this shampoo is that it doesn't leave my hair feeling heavy or weighed down. And it also smells SO good! This will definitely be my go to shampoo now!",1
"I am a huge fan of this shampoo. I love the scent and it leaves my hair feeling clean. I paired it with the conditioner and my hair feels alive. I highly recommend this product. I was selected to test Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.",1
"As a mom of a tiny hurricane toddler, washing my hair comes lucky enough if I can do it twice a week. My old shampoos by that point have left my hair feeling greasy and not good. I tried the Aussie Volume Shampoo, not only does it smell amazing it hasn't made my hair feel gross. The bottle is a little hard to open but I'm okay with that, or else tiny human will pour it everywhere. I did notice volume when I've left my hair down or the extra oomph to my mom bun. I received this product for free but the opinions are my own. And this brand will be replacing my old go to.",1
I want to start off by saying that i did recieve this aussie volume shampoo free for my review and honest feedback. I really am in love with the amazing clean smell that this shampoo has. I have always been a huge fan of aussie products for this reason but also for the quality and great results that i get when using. I recieved the volume shampoo and it really does work. I like how it doesnt leave my hair greasy and lifeless like most other hair brands and it gives me that extra boost of volume i need. I would recommend to anyone looking for that extra volume and that smell good hair all day long.,1
"I bought this shampoo yesterday and tried it for the first time. I like the scent, and love how my hair looks! It is noticeably fuller and has lift at the crown. Much more volume than with other more expensive shampoos. So happy I found it. I have highlighted and lowlighted hair and it makes it nicely full but not coarse. Thank you for a great product!",1
I received my Aussie voluminizimg shampoo from Influenster this past week . I have been using the shampoo for about a week and I must say that I love how soft it leaves my hair. Not only do I love the softness I also love that it's full of volume. I've tried high and shampooed that claim my hair will be voluminous and I have to say that Aussie is by far my favorite ! We girl wants to have soft manageable hair and the shampoo has given me that I've added curls and they stay all day thank you so much Aussie !!,1
"I received some Aussie products free from Influenster to try and I have to say that I really, really like them. They smell great and my hair is so smooth and manageable and has more volume than when using my regular brand. I will definitely buy Aussie from now on!",1
"I have very thin, fine hair. I'm growing it out so it's usually pretty flat just because it gets weighed down so easily. But this is the very first product that has actually worked in giving me volume! And I've tried a ton of products. I'm so impressed with this line. It also smells great! I received this product as a test product from Influenster and I will most definitely be buying it in the future.",1
"I don't use a lot of shampoo but with this kind, you don't need a lot. I was able to work up a lather really easy and the smell was absolutely amazing. Once I rinsed it out I used the aussie volume conditioner. I dried my hair upside down and the volume was amazing. I have recommended this to friends and family already. I did receive this for free but all opinions are honest and my own.",1
"This shampoo does work as advertised, leaving hair clean, soft and with as much extra volume as other volumizer shampoos I've tried.",1
This shampoo is used by my husband who wanted a good shampoo that really cleaned his hair well and this is really awesome. Smells great and the conditioner keeps his hair looking and feeling just right.,1
Leaves your hair soft and smelling very nice.,1
My previous shampoo left my hair greasy. This product is great and does not leave it greasy.,1
This is my favorite shampoo. I have fine hair and this shampoo is perfect. It smells so good and the price is awesome. I use this every day and I stocked up so the whole family is using it.,1
Great product will by again,1
Love their products!,1
I loved my wife liked very much recommended perfect,1
this is the only product i use on my hair its awesome,1
this is such a great product,1
I recieved this product as a tester too try it out. After I shampoo and conditioned my hair with these products it made a very good difference.. My hair is long and curly and this made my hair feel so soft and smells so good.,1
This product really surprised me! It not only lifts my natural curly hair off my scalp but it makes my curls look big and defined at the same time I would definitely recommend this to a friend!,1
I love it I can't get enough! My hair is really long so I go thru this like water but i will continue to repurchase. It doesn't leave my hair oily or dry. It's hard for me to find a good shampoo,1
This shampoo does not weigh my hair down and does not make it feel icky.. and the scent was a bonus to ensure I would use again. I received Aussie for free but my opinions are all my own!,1
"i had tried other products aussie but never this shampoo, now I use it every day to wash ny hair and I love its smell. it doesnt gives ne dandruff or alergy and controls frizz perfectly. i love it",1
"Absolutely love! My hair always looks and feels great when used. I tested Aussie for free, but all opinions are my own.",1
"I enjoyed using this product. It smelled good and was light weight. I didn't tell much of a difference, but it was still a great shampoo.",1

"Really like this shampoo,lathers great,rinses clean, only takes a small amount,so it lasts a long time. Good product.",1
"I'm always testing shampoo. I decided on this because I wanted basic, thorough cleansing, and that's just what I got! No gunk, no residue good lather, fun fragrance--albeit very fruity in an unidentifiable way. The texture of this shampoo is great too because it's thick without being creamy. I hope you keep this going! I'm very happy right now--and that's saying a lot for someone as picky as me. Thanks Aussie!",1
"I first tried Aussie Aussome Volume Shampoo when it was accidently left in my shower by a visiting relative upon her departure.... It is sooo rich and makes such a lovely full lather! AND, I swear, it does leave my hair with more volume!! (I ran out of it and tried another product that could not compete with it....only because I could not get out to a store that carries it at that point in time...) But, never again, if I have my way! I am sticking with this great product!",0
"For me it's working grate! I even don't use conditioner!Recommended for use with my type of hair very high! Med. Blond, baby think, dry to med.",0
"I'm kind of sad to see the poor reviews on this product, so I thought I'd write my own. For some reason my hair hates hard water more than most people (we have hard well water, and although the rest of my family noticed their hair was a little less healthy looking, mine looked and felt DISGUSTING because I just could not get the minerals out of my hair, and continuing to wash it only made it worse). This is the only shampoo/conditioner combo that fixed that problem. I had even tried an expensive hard water shampoo that didn't work nearly as well. Even if you don't have hard water issues, this shampoo really made my hair feel lighter and way more voluminous. Everyone's hair is different, but I definitely recommend at least giving this one a try!",1

"This is my fist time trying any type of Aussie product. I have been wanting to try them for a long time, but I was a little hesitant. I'm really glad that I was given an opportunity to try it. First of all, it smells so good. I love the smell. Some hair shampoos does not have a good smell, but this does have the most delicious scent. I also like the volume it gave my hair. I wanted a light volume, so it did the job. The only small complaint I have about the package is that the top is hard to open. I try to keep from breaking my nails every time I try to open it. But other than that I liked it. I did tested this Aussie product for free, but all opinions are my own.",1

"This is really cute to watch for Mater lovers. My 2 1/2 year old grandson loves it, so do his grandfater I :)",0
This movie was good.,0
My 4 year old son begged me for this movie and he has watched over and over. If your son likes Cars and Mater they will love this one.,1
It's a great addition of stories for any little Cars-aholic :),1
This dvd of Mater telling tall tales of his real/imagined adventures is entertaining for the whole family. Mater and Lightening McQueen are joined by new and old Cars characters in 9 shorts. My children love these characters and were thrilled to see them again in new stories. ....Target offered this DVD at the best price and it was on my door step quickly. This is just one reason Target is my retailer of choice!,0
Kept the grand kids occupied and glued to the TV Recommend this DVD for all kids that like car videos,1
Very happy my son to sub for you guys this watch it over and over and over and over he calls it monster trucks,1
Very good movie for kids and they will love it for sure.,1
"I bought this for my kids while looking at the DVD section of my local store. My kids saw and wanted it since the story involved ""Cars"". They love Tow Mater and loved this DVD. It's a must have for any ""Cars"" fans you have in your family.",1
Great DVD. I was hoping this would be released one day.,1
My three year old loves this movie!!! He wants to watch this movie over and over again,1
"This DVD is a series of shorts featuring the Cars characters Tow-mater and Lightning McQueen. Kids will enjoy the silly antics of the cars, but grown-ups will appreciate the humor aimed straight at them (this IS a Pixar production). Tow-mater tells all kinds of tall tales that feature send-ups of classic film genres (Sci-Fi, Film Noir Detective, etc.) and popular culture (Monster Trucks, WWE Wrestling, Tokyo Drift, etc.). This is a DVD that you will gladly play over and over again.",0
My son loved cars and he enjoys Mater the most. Loved it.,0

Great movie,0
My Lil boy loves this movie,0
"Great find for the perfect gift, when I could not find it in store.",1
"My Grandsons favorite movie, shipment was quick and product was great!!",1
Fun for all ages,1
We have loved both Cars and Cars 2 movies for years!! I never realized there were any additional movies made until I came across Mater's Tales!! Knowing that my son LOVES Lightening I figured I would try this thinking it might not be a hit since it's all about Mater but boy was I wrong!!! Not only does my son love this video but my 2 yr old daughter loves it too!! They watch this together and laugh from start to finish!!! Definitely a hit!!!,1
"This is awesome.. all Mater all the time. My 2 year old never sat through movies or shows for long, he sat through this whole DVD over and over. When we would ask him what he wanted to watch he would say MATER. Its not a movie, Its about 8 short films on mater and his tall tales of his adventures. Its fun to watch. Although after the hundredth time watching it as a parent I was over it! haha",1
I bought it for my great-grandson's 3rd birthday. And he loves it.,1
"My daughter who is 3.5 years old loves these. She does not have the attention span to watch a feature-length film, but these shorts keep her entertained for a long time. The stories are short enough that she doesn't lose interest.",1
My 4yo son cant get enough of Maters tall tales. He will hold the dye cast car of him for each of the short stories he knows everyline tells others the full story.,1
"My 4 year old grandson really loves this movie. I got it for him for this Christmas. He loves mine so much, I got him his own.",1
What can you say about Mater but dad gum! My grandchildren and even all if us adults love watching this movie over and over!,1
My 2 year old grandson loves this movie. When it finishes he wants to play it again.,1
"I bought this as a replacement copy of one lost a few months ago. It is a great hit in our family, especially the boys! It will be one of those classics that can be watched at any age!",1
My 2-year old son loves the Cars series and he loved this DVD. Very cute!,1
I bought this movie for my 2 year old son and he absolutely loves it! They are funny little skits that the entire family can enjoy,1
The movie is awsome!,1

I scream when I look into the Mirror now. This product rashes up my face and neck. I itch non-stop for days. My cheeks were red and bumpy.,0
Still too early to tell but I like how soft it makes my skin. Hoping it gets rid of my dry skin and rash. Dermatologist highly recommended it.,0
My husband's dermatologist recommended this product we've been using it for some time on his dry skin. It works very well.,0
"This product was recommended by my dermatologist and I must say I'm so glad she did! I was given a sample and from the first application, I saw results. I couldn't find the cream in the store or pharmacy in my area so I ordered it online and did fast deliverly. It has been more effective than many of the prescriptions I have received in the past. I'm so satisfied with the results and would recommend this product to anyone who has extremely dry skin because it left my skin feeling baby soft and smooth!",0
"I have been using this product for a few years now, it was recommended to me by my dermatologist. My skin is very dry and scaly patches and bumps form on my lower arms and legs. This is the best cream I have found that will keep my skin moist and removes all the dead skin that forms. I also use two other CeraVe products, the moisturizing cream and the renewing lotion. The moisturizer I use on the remaining parts of my body and the lotion on my face. I would highly recommend these products to people with dry skin, especially older women like me.",0
"I talked to my dermatologist about the roughness of the skin on the back of my upper arms, which had also become a problem on my legs, including reddish bumps. He told me to use this cream once a day. It took several weeks to see any effects, but I now have perfectly smooth skin in those problematic areas. I am very pleased with the effectiveness of this product, I know that the rough upper arm area is a problem for a lot of women, and I hope that word gets around that this cream solves that problem.",0
"This product is like a miracle cream. Being diabetic, it is great for feet therapy. Works wonders. Very hard to find and not all Walmarts have it. Check on line and reserve it there.",0
"This was recommended by my dermatologist for very dry skin with eczema. It works!!! No greasy feeling, leaves skin soft and itchiness is gone. Great product",0
I have bumps on my arms and legs and was advised by my dermatologist to try this lotion. It took a couple weeks but seriously cleared up my skin! It is the only lotion I use now. It makes my skin feel great and moisturizer all day.,0
"Suggested by my Dermatologist. It is excellent for dry skin. I am a senior and many years of sun have dried my skin and this is the best of all the lotions and potions Rx and OTC that I have used. Some have been like a paste that would not spread and others were useless. This really does the trick. A little more expensive than the regular CeraVe but I use less, it goes farther, and works like a charm. It's not greasy and goes in well.",0
I noticed a change almost immediately.,0
It helped save my feet from Diabetic foot problems.,0
"THIS WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY DERMATOLOGIST FOR PLAQUING PSORIASIS, IT KEEPS ALL OF THE PLAQUE OFF IF I USE IT DAILY AFTER SHOWER.....I LOVE IT",0
"my skin doc recommended this over a year ago , I bought some around 6 months ago . this really helps my dry skin , my hands get so bad some fabrics like silk catch on my hands , and I hate that feeling after applying this lotion silk does not catch on my hands , it runs threw them like my skin is baby soft ! to me that's a miracle ! I have major allergies to lotions , laundry soaps , bath soaps , my skin gets so dry it cracks . then I have to use an ointment and bandaids , but once the crack heals to where it is not bleeding I appy this all day and at night , and it has my hands soft by morning .",0
"My doctor recommended I purchase this for my extremely dry skin. I have tried several products in the past but I have allergies to products and with my Excema it was hard to find a product that I could use and would work. The cream is better then the lotion. The cream is so creamy. It feels instantly good on your skin. It doesn't bother my excema when I put it on, which is amazing because that was a big problem. It doesn't have harsh chemicals in it. I live in the desert and My skin was so very dry. This cream is a lifesaver.",0
"My Mom uses this on her legs. She is diabetic and has extreme varicose veins. Her legs get extremely dry and seem to swell a lot more when they get dry. She's started putting this on them and they look SO MUCH better, and don't seem to swell so much. I also use it and it seems to really make a difference, and works better than other things I've used. I'm sticking with it.",0
I tend to have chicken skin and this stuff really helps keep it looking and feeling normal. Kinda pricey but worth every penny to be able to wear short sleeves and not be self conscious.,0
"This product was recommended to me for my dry skin, especially during the Winter. I have been using it on my arms for two weeks now, and the dry patches have disappeared. It goes on easily and leaves the skin soft. I would not recommend it for facial use, as I tried that and had to wash it off because it stung my sensitive skin.",0
I have extremely dry skin and i have used a wide range of products in the past but the result was either a greasy finish or not moisturizing enough. I really wish i had known about this cream sooner. This product gives a new definition to moisturizing!!! I noticed a significant difference the first day i used it !!! My skin felt much softer and smoother and had a really nice glow. I have eczema and very sensitive skin and this cream did not aggravate it at all. Would highly recommend buying it.,0
This was the only cream that made a significant change to my dry skin condition. Cerave SA Cream really works!!!! My eczema is better controlled with this product. An excellent product indeed. I recommend purchasing it online and picking it up at the store as it will be a few dollars cheaper that way.,0
This took the bumps on my arms away .Also it stops my awfu! Itching of dry skin.,0
Great product and walmart had it at lowest price,0
It is working well and I am looking forward to finally having beautiful elbows.,0
Great for dry skin!,0
this product really works,0
"Tiny little box, Filled with great Marzipan memories...Thank you",1
Almond paste filled cookies have been a Christmas favorite in our family for years. We always use the SOLO brand because it is always of excellent quality.,1
great product - have used for years - have problem finding in local supermarkets lately- price is fair but shipping adds a lot - holiday time need it so you have to pay to get it,1
Good quality,1
Best I have used so far,1
"The product is OK, the scent is barely noticeable. Overpriced",1
"Bought large quantity, with out realising the above. Very good result if you use the long run (2hr and above)",1
sparkle and shine! glitter and glow.. finish the dirt with Finish Quantum Dirt and grease gone with No rinse aid and salt.. love them,1
The cheaper Finish was leaving white residue on our dishes. This one is better and our dishes don't have as much white residue now.,1
I love the Lemony smell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"All the other brands in the line-up are' dirt-cheap' See me cut through the opposition with a Quantum Leap If you want a quality clean and sparkle on every dish Then go for gold, choose Powerball's photo FInish",1
"Love the smell, love the cleanliness, and sparkling pots pans,glassess, plates, and cutelry. could not fault this at all.",1
All in one. Lime scale prevention. Salt. Grease removal. Stain removal. rinse aid. So much easier to store. Excellent results. Fresh smell from the dishwasher.,1
"I loaded my first dishwasher at the age of 10, I have grown up watching mom use Finish. So when I bought my first dishwasher - I did some research to see if there were any products I must use and rediscovered Finish and since then I have never used any other brand because I have been completely satisfied with the performance and the lovely fragrance the Lemon Sparkle Power Balls give when I open my dishwasher.",1
only had my dishwasher since october 2012 and wouldnt use anything else,1
Lovely smell and leaves the plates with a sparkly shine :-) - Even the dishwasher looks like new after a wash!,1
I love my dishwasher cant use anything else then Finish products.Quantum lemon do dishes smells fantastic and really clean.fantastic!!!,1
"My Cutlery and crockery came out shining, allowing time for wining and dining!",1
"HAVING A 3 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER MEANS I HAVE NO TIME AT ALL, BUT AFTER FINDING FINISH DISHWASHER TABLETS I HAVE REALISED I DON'T KNOW HAVE TO PRE-WASH ALL MY DISHES BEFORE PUTTING THEM IN MY DISHWASHER....WHICH NOW MEANS PUT BABY DOWN TO SLEEP I CAN SIT BACK RELAX AND CONDEMN MY RUBBER GLOVES TO THE BIN!",1
Great quality and a great price,1
"Cleans marvelously, with a nice, but subtle, lemon scent.",1
For a dazzling shine that won't diminish I use Quantum Finish!,1
"Not only did it make my dishes and glasses squeaky clean , but smelt good Thought I needed a new dish washer but with finish they are a s good as new",1
"Great product, worth the extra few pence. Since using this i have never opened the dishwasher door to find half cleaned stuff or smeary glasses.",1
I would never use finish anytime until i got a free sample i thought nothing could beat my other dish washer tablet well how wrong was i finish is fantastic and i will never use anything else again i could not believe how clean it made my dishes .,1
"I RECENTLY USED FINISH QUANTUM FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER I FOUND SOME OTHER DISHWASHER TABLETS LEFT STREAKS ON MY GLASSES/PLATES AND I WOULD END UP HAVING TO SPEND LONGER HAND WASHING THEM AGAIN, BUT FINISH QUANTUM DIDN'T ONLY LEAVE MY PLATES/GLASSES SPARKLING BUT ALSO MY PREVIOUSLY TIRED EYES ALSO HAD A NEW SPARKLE IN THEM!",1
"i love it, no hassle, leaves my dishes lovley and clean , my glasses sparkling and my machine spelling lovely and zesty!!",1
"The product is very efficient, it cleans all the dishes very well making all the diahes sparkle when they come out of the dishwasher. Best product I have used so far.",1
excellent product. would recomend to buy again anytime for washing dishes or cleaning guns,1
"it worked really well and left my dishes sparkling clean,and it made my kitchen smell nice too",1
Definitely will buy again. I trust this brand completely and every product they make.,1
"I don't use anything other than Finish Quantum Lemon Sparkle in my dishwasher for a number of reasons. First and foremost, nothing gets my dishes cleaner and sparklier than these tablets. They are so easy to use, just pop one out and pop it into the machine and you are good to go. My dishes come out perfectly clean, sparkling and streak free. That is the best part and there is an added bonus. When you open the machine you are greeted with a lovely fresh lemon scent! I cannot recommend this highly enough. After going through a stage of using shops own and cheaper brands, I have changed and now only use Finish Quantum. It may cost a wee bit more than the average dishwasher tablet but it is worth the extra to not have to re-wash dishes. Try it for yourself ... you will be very very pleasantly surprised.",1
"Cleans dishes leaving them Lemon Squeaky clean, just brilliant !",1
I've used Finish for.. 39 years and it's always been my favorite dishwashing detergent. These new power Gels... are even better yet. Finish makes a great product and it always gets my dishes clean and sparkly. Thanks Finish!,1
as always Finish does a great job!! love the lemony smell..,1
Finish Quantum Lemon Sparkle is the best ever for cleaning everything from class to cookware. It all comes out sparkling clean and it smells nice and fresh too.,1
"my glasses and crockery are always sparkling when I use finish, so I use it all the time and I love the clean lemon scent",1
once tried I will not be going back to my old dishwashing product,1
I have had a dishwasher for many years and can honestly say that this product has given me the best results I have ever seen especially on a overproof dish in which I had cooked lasagne. An extra bonus is that the dishwasher smells clean and fresh affter using the tablets.,1
they left the dishes really shiny and looking really clean what a good finish,1
This set is very soft and my 2 year old son loves it! He loves carrying the sheet around the house.,0
"Cute frame, cant wait until the baby gets here to use it",1
Very easy on the hands to use. I used it on card stock with no problem....especially for a punch of this size.,1
"I used this on my 2 boys on the 4th of July, ages 5 9. We have a huge block party with water balloons, swimming, playing in sprinklers. The boys were in their suits all day i re-applied several times through out the day, each time I put it on the boys, they were wet. Well at the end of the day, they were also very burned! I used a coppertone on my daughter and she did not get burned at all. I have been telling all my friends NOT to buy this I would never buy it again.",1
"I have used this sunscreen twice. The first time I got burned, but had been in the water so I thought it was because of that. Today my husband and I both used it, and we are so burned! We were outside for a couple hours and did not get wet at all. I applied it 20 minutes before we went outside and rubbed it in. My husband only used it on part of his body and those parts were just as burned as the areas he did not use it on. I definitely DO NOT recommend this product!!!",1
"After applying as directed, we went swimming and then reapplied after an hour. We burned in that one hour! Not only that, but our skin is a rusty orange color! It looks like we sprayed ourselves with a cheap self tan. We have used the regular Neutrogena Sun Block spray and this did not happen. Went for the wet skin bottle this time and it didn't work for us.",1
"After 1 day of use, I developed a red itchy rash on all areas that were sprayed.",1
"This product goes on sticky and if it get near your eyes, they will get irritated. I must say though that it did work. I was out in harsh sun all day and did not get burned, nor browned.",1
This sunblock works and this is great! Great improvement on already great products.,1
my family spends alot of time in the sun. We enjoyed paddleboarding a the beach for 4 hours on Saturday morning. With sunscreen protection no one got burned and no irritation,0
"I have used Neutrogena Wet Skin many times since it first came out and its the best sunscreen I have ever used. I spray this in my hands to put on my face and spray and spread around on the rest of me. This will stick to my skin while I am still sweating, which is essential! I also do not have issues with sunscreen running in my eyes and stinging. I HIGHLY recommend this sunscreen. Be aware that it is more difficult to remove (good makeup wipes work great) and may stain lighter colored swimsuits.",0
"We live in our pool and I can never get my husband or kids to put on sunscreen because they hate the feel of lotions (so do I), and they don't want to interrupt their swimming to dry off and reapply sunscreen. This is great - I carry it around with me and spray everybody, even if they're dripping. You can see this bead up the moisture on the skin, so you know it's not rinsing off. We all tan like crazy, so we don't use this to prevent sunburn, but it seems to stop us from getting too tan and it keeps our skin soft. Be careful not to inhale when you spray this - it's not a good experience.",1
Great coverage! I bought it because I was tired of putting on lotions. The spray goes on much better! Just spray and go!,1
"Being extremely pale-skinned, I've received my fair share of sunburns, even after using sunblock, although admittedly probably not often enough. I've been using this sunblock most of the summer and have not burned, even with a few all day outings! I love how easy it is to apply and it doesn't make your skin stay white like some mineral-based sunscreens. Loving this product -- it's been great for all of my outdoor sports!",1
Love this sunscreen as you just spray and no need to rub it in,1
I used this product while I was in Hawaii. I spent quite a bit of time in the water and found that it worked really well. It also has a great scent!,1
"Goes on well, stays on. I don't burn and I'm very fair skinned.",1
Just used this product on a vacation in Florida- it worked great! What a terrific idea!!!,1
this is a great product but don't ship it. When it came it was leaking I didn't bother to contact anyone since I ordered two and only one was oozing out. It was a mess but able to be salvaged,0
Clean well and like that it doesn't contain wax. be sure and wipe window after seems to make them streak a bit,1
One of the few car washes that don't have wax mixed in. Great suds to lift dirt,0
"A gift for my son-in-law as his favorite car care products are Meguiar's. Trying this wash for the first time. Expect it to follow the same quality of other Meguire's products. Ordered on line, picked up in store, excellent experience with customer service.",1
"Meguiar's Deep Crystal Car Wash 64-oz. is top of the line car wash with excellent properties within the formula.

Each time I wash my car with Meguiars the Sparkle comes back....,1
Exact same soap sold at auto zone for half the price ! I will just purchase my car soap from here now,1
I didn't use it yet but I'm sure it will be good,1
Cleans my black SUV exceptionally well without leaving water marks. Rinses clean. I have used this product on a weekly basis since April of 2012.,0
Makes good suds and cleans well.,0
Lots of suds and slippery to the touch!,0
Great just wash and rinse. Reay easy.,0
will definitely buy again highly recommend very good value.,0
This is the only car wash soap my husband will use! And he is extremely picky!,0

exactly what I ordered,0
Car wash as advertised,0
"I am very fair and burn easily in the sun. I was excited to try this product after reading some reviews. I have tried this lotion several times, thinking I was applying it wrong or something. Everytime I use it, It leaves blotches, especially on my arms and chest no matter how much I tried to rub it in evenly. It also took too long to completely dry. If it is not completely dry, you will have lighter spots where your clothes rub your skin or where your arms bend and such. I just cannot stand still for 30 minutes to an hour for the lotion to dry, not touching anything! The color looked pretty orange. It also had a very bad smell after it was left on for a few hours. Also, it washes right off in the shower so don't even think about taking a bath with this because you will be bathing in orange water. The only thing I do like about the lotion is that it gives you color right away and becomes darker over time, but it'd be better if the color wasn't orange. I absolutely HATE this product and I do not recommend it to anyone, especially fair skinned people.",0
I was excited to get this sunless lotion cause it didn't have a lot of bad reviews. As soon as I read them I rushed off to Wal-Mart to get it. I got home and read the directions twice before I applied it. I started from bottom to top of my body and got my husband to help with my back just to insure no streaks. As soon as I put it on I was getting the color. And the smell wasn't bad at all. It says to dry completely before you put your clothes back on and to wait 2-3 hours before you get your final color. The 3rd hour came and gone and I could barely tell any difference at all. So I decided to sleep with it on. Got up the next morning and took a shower. The water was Orange and it was so greasy. Took forever for that part to go away. When I got out I looked at my toes and streaks everywhere! I rubbed it off with the towel thinking Itwouldn't come off and I was about to be stuck with orange streaked toes. It came right off. I looked it the mirror to see what my body looked like and OMG orange and streaks all over!!!!! If I could put a pic. on here and show you I would. white spots everywhere. I would not use this again and would not want my friends to look like this.,0
I've been using this product for about a month and have seen no color change. I would like my money back.,1
"This is a very fast-acting lotion, I'll give it that. My problem is that after using it for about a week (like it says on the bottle), I turned a color that was more of a yellow/orange than anything else. Run away!!!!!!!",0
Have used Summer Color light/medium on my legs according to directions nearly every day for over a month. There has been absolutely no color change. I've had success with other sunless tanning products. Going back to them.,1
"I'm very pale and I didn't want to look like Casper during the summer so I got on here and looked at the reviews for this and they were all good so I bought it. It does work. I used it 3 days in arow once a day just so I could get to the color I wanted all over my body. After the third day I stopped and the second day after I stopped putting it on my hands, feet, chest, and arms got blochy. So I had unsightly pale spots and then really tan spots all over so I decided to use it again. When I put it on and waited for three hours for it to set and get it's color I turned orange! So not only did I have spots I was orange! So if you don't put it on everyday you get spots but if you do put it on everyday you turn orange, I hate this product. And that's not the only thing, if you don't use this in large amounts you will get streaks. Since the bottle is so small and I use it for my whole body I only got 6 uses out of it. If you're pale like me I wouldn't recommend this product at all!",0
"I like the results, except I think it's causing my skin to itch like crazy... I'm trying to find out other products you have that might not do that..",1
"BE PREPARED.....unless you mix this with a light lotion, like Curel mix equal parts, you may have that orangy tint.I saw a video on utube a gal mixed about 1 teaspoon of moisture lotion with 1 teaspoon of this tanner.Now i only use it on my fingers. Just below the knuckles as i tan everywhere BUT THERE! I did it the first time it really didn't change a lot. I should have waited til the next day do it again. Instead, i got impatient just put it over my fingers by itself, not moisture lotion with it. I did it 2 times like that it turned kinda orangy. You have to wipe it off the bends of your fingers as well, or it sets in darker also wipe it off the palms of your hand. That was the only part that turned orange had i have keep using it with the lotion, i don't think i would have had that orangy look. Make sure you don't get it on the inner part of your fingers too. I can't find that video anymore but the girl was very good informative.Read full review...",1
This is a fairly good product. It's easy to see where it has been applied which helps to get an even application. It dries and tans quickly but needs a couple applications to get decent color. It does have the unpleasant odor but not as strong as other brands. I would buy it again.,1

"Just tried this product for the first time. It did streak, even though it's advertised that it doesn't streak. Would not recommend without giving a heads-up that this product does streak. Color was good except for the streaking.",1
Will turn you orange if not very careful. Do not apply heavy. I'm a pale skin blonde,1
"I looked online for a great self-tanner and saw this one had a bunch of great reviews, so I decided to buy it, since I am fair skinned and usually cannot get a natural tan. Once I got it, I follwed the instructions just as it said, smoothed the product in very well, and turned out the next day to have streaks and an orangish brown tan. I was really embarrased and got called a tangerine by my friends. I thought the next day i could use it again and maybe it would smooth it out, and it did sorta but still left me with a few streaks and still an orange pigment on my skin. Also if you wanna keep the color then you have to put the lotion on a bunch! Usually after i took a shower most of my orangey tan skin color was gone! It isn't a very good product for the size and quality of it. I used about half of the bottle in less than a week. Overall I wouldnt reccomend this product unless you really want to risk getting an orangish skin color.",0
"I've been searching for a self tanner that won't make me look more yellow because I'm Asian and my skin is pale and has a warm undertone so I'm already a little yellowish bc I'm asian and even more yellow with olive undertone. So it's really hard to find self tanners with a red undertone which this one has. It doesn't make me deep dark as its name but I'm 2 shades darker with only a little bit of yellow tint when with other self tanners I have tried that people claim are amazing makes me way too yellow or orange to go in public.If it works for a rare case like me, I'm sure it will work with everyone else.It doesn't cost much at least it is worth it to give it a try.",1
"arrived a day after I ordered, color is a little orange but if you mix it with lotion or aloe vera it's good",1
"To prevent smearing, after applying it evenly where you want it, go back to it after a couple minutes and run your fingers over it again. This will even it out better and will make it look natural. Original effect only last a couple days, then it continues to fade out up to 6-7 days.",1

"I've used this product for about a week now, and I love it. After the first two uses (first day) the streakiness went away, so I guess that's just a beginning thing. I've noticed a significant change in the color, my legs finally match my arms. I wore leggings basically all year before using this product for a week. My only sour note is that when the bottle says to use sparingly around the ankles, do it. My ankles were a little dark, but the color lightened up with a little bit of body wash and a luffa. The smell, isn't bad, but it isn't great. I would suggest some kind of coconut or tropical scent to be added. I'm fairly impressed with the scent as it is though considering most self-tanner smell like acid.",1
"the lotion works good and has a nice scent, just make sure you pay attention when applying it around your ankles and knees.....just like they say, it will make those areas extremely dark, making them appear as though they are dirty",0
"I wanted to tan my legs from sandal area up to my upper thighs. Decided to follow the suggestions, so showered and shaved my legs before using it. After drying off, I applied a moderate amount and applied it with both hands making sure there weren't any areas that had it thicker than others. It worked fine. On one later application, I was rushed so left off shaving until a couple hours after applying this, on the basis that it would be dried off enough. That was a mistake, because along with the little whiskers came a lot of the lotion that had been turned to a gunky consistency. Also, because of the rush I didn't have time to make sure it was applied totally evenly, and ended up with a couple streaks which were embarrassing. As long as you apply this after you have shaved any areas as normal, and then take the time to apply it evenly - even to the point that you gently stroke the area again a few minutes after finishing the application to make sure there are no thick spots left - it works. Take care to not put much at all (if any) on areas of dry or hard skin, such as areas of feet and knees, elbows, etc, because they will end up darker than the rest. This works fine. I think I was right to pick this before a darker tan, and apply a couple times, because it looked much better, much more like a real tan and less like something out of a bottle or tube. The lotion itself made my skin noticeably softer for a few days afterwards, so that was a lovely bonus. I could do without the fragrance, but it's not totally unpleasant.",0
This product does not have the usual smell of so many sunless lotions and I love that about it. The color comes out very natural looking although you may have to apply a couple times to get a good noticeable difference depending on how dark you want to look. I will be buying this product again.,0
"Very effective, If you'r light complexed like I am, it gives you a tan that last about a week",0
"Great value, works great",0
Was glad to find the product online because it was sold out out the 2 wal-mart stores that I checked. I use it on my legs year around to keep them from being so white.........,1
"Sunless tanner can honestly be hit or miss but I can honestly say this product is right on the money. It comes out with just enough color to see where you're putting it but not too much that it's going to come off on anything, it's moisturizing unlike most tanners so you won't be cringing from dry skin, the smell isn't offensive and the price is really good compared to other tanners. Once it develops it's a really nice natural color with no streaks. I love this product.. Two thumbs up :) This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
This has to be the smoothest creamiest lotion I have ever used in my life.Know I can't live without it,1
I really like this product. It's a tinted lotion so it makes the application process much easier and less streaks or missed areas. Great color too!!! My only complaint is how splotchy it is between the applications. I do exfoliate daily and maybe that is why but I also have eczema. It just makes it difficult to enjoy it like the rest of the consumers when I have to wait to apply it. I highly recommend this product though.,1
I usually tan good in the tanning bed and sun but ive been short on time and the tanning bed isnt healthy so i was on here reading reviews and decided to go w/ this one.. i was really iffy about it but i was willing to give it a try.. the first day i used it and it says u will see results in 2-3 hours..i felt like i could but it might have been in my head.. so later that day i put more on and my family was saying i looked darker.. when i put it on a make sure im careful about it so it doesnt go on uneven and stuff.. and it seems to do really good.. the only thing is watch really dry skin..like on the top on my big toes they are really dry and i put it on them and u could tell it looked awful but i just stopped putting it there also it has a slight greasy feeling but its not horrible..and i was working out w/ it on and where i sweat like on my arms u could see it looked like i was dirty but i took a shower and it went away.. but i really do like it.. im just throughing out the warnings .,0
"I have a really good tan on my upper body so when I decided to wear shorts I didn't have a Tan so I wanted to get one fast so I could wear shorts and start to get a real tan.IT REALLY IS STREAK FREE!!! the only bad thing about it is, i would put lotion on my feet ankles knees before i put this on because it made my knees feet and ankles look a bit dirty. But other then that it's perfect. The first time i put it on it really didn't do much at all but the second time i put it on then went to bed when i woke up I had a really nice tan, natural looking and no streaks at all. Plus it didn't leave my palms looking orange or dirty either. I apply it 1 maybe 2 times a week. The smell isn't bad at all, and if you have really dry skin then I would mix it w/ some regular lotion too.",0
"I love this self tanning lotion! It's simple, quick and easy to apply. I usually don't like to use Tanners with a guide color or tint because it settles in my pores and I get those dreaded brown speckels all over, but the tint in this lotion looks great and doesn't settle in my pores. I've always used sprays and always thought that the application and results were the best. Until I tried banana boat deep dark lotion and found the application a piece of cake, especially since using gloves is a pain and stains your hands with most lotions, but banana boat easily washes off palms, way less hassle to apply than sprays, and, for me, the color is much more natural and the color stays true longer before any obvious fading. I'm a convert!!",1
"I have been using this product for over a year now. It has worked very well for me, plus it doesn't rub off on your clothes as long as you give it 15-20 min to dry. As long as you rub it in very well it won't come out streaky, and if you apply it to your knees, elbows, ankle, or face use it very sparingly or mix it with regular lotions to prevent orangeyness. Also if you have light colored skin defiantly DONT think about getting the dark lotion instead of the medium one to get a darker tan. My friend decided to do this and her whole body turned an ugly dark orange color.",0
I'm very pale and use the Deep/Dark shade and it gives me a natural looking tan....no orange color!! I haven't had any issues with streaking. I do use a self tanner mitt to apply. Does have a slight smell but not horrible.,1
This is the best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used! It dries fast and is not sticky at all. Gives me good color even after just one application.,1
"I've tried many self-tanners, and for me this beats most. Cost effective, and more important, it works. I've learned to mix a little body oil rather than lotion with this. Smooths on beautifully, dries quickly, leaves a better scent, and gives me the color I want. I use Jergens Shea dry body oil. I also use a body scrub and hand soap on my hands afterwards. No orange. I probably use this between two to three times a week to keep a good color. Banana Boat is BY FAR MUCH BETTER THAN LOREAL SELF TANNER. Did not like the results. Very weak color. Try this...I think you'll like it.",1
This self tanner is awesome....Gives you a nice brown shade to your skin. It smells good too. Just make sure to wash your hands right after applying. I totally recommend this product!,1
I always use this taner. It works great and gives a really nice natural tan with no streaks.,1
"I've used this product on my legs, in the summer, for years. A quick even tan, no heavy fragrance. My experience is, if applied after a shower (on dry, un-lotioned skin), and then forego scrubbing skin when showering in daily showers after that (I let the soapy water sluice over to dry and pat dry) your nice tan will fade away evenly and you'll be ready for an re-application in 5-7 days. On the day of re-applicatoin, I will go ahead and scrub my legs with a bath sponge to prepare for an even application. Can you over-apply and end up with splotchiness Yes. But what I described above generally guarantees a natural looking, non-splotchy, evenly fading tan you can rely on, all summer.",1
I have been using this tanner for 5 years. It is wonderful and has no odor. Ebay is the best place to buy it!,1
"Where can i start This is my second self-tanner, the other was Kroger Brand. It smelled great, but did absolutely nothing. THIS brand is by far the best! You never get streaks, unless you use too little of the product and try to spread too little around your legs. By the way, this can be used anywhere on your body, even your face, and it didn't break me out. I'm very pale naturally, and this is the only one that makes me look NATURALLY tan. The only small flaw is that since you use a good amount of the product, so you don't streak, you go through it rather quickly. But that's just me. So, buy in bulk, as it doesn't get sold in every walmart near me, at least. Overall, the best for your buck for ANY need to look NATURALLY TAN.",0
"I think this product is great. It goes on easy and the color lasts a long time. It does get dirty looking around your knees and ankles, however if you apply regular body lotion after the tanning lotion and rub those area's it smooths it right out and matches the color. I also apply less tanning lotion to those areas and it seems to not give you the dirty look. This is great product for someone who cannot go out in the sun and get a normal tan. It does not make your skin look orange either..... I highly recommend.",0
"I am so pleased with this product, especially the value! You get quick results, it's a nice dark (but natural) color and it doesn't streak! Best self-tanner I've ever used.",1
"I have been using this self-tanner for years. For a while, I had a difficult time finding it and in that time I have tried every brand available...from high end to low. Without question, Banana Boat is the best. It does not streak at all. I get a compliment everyday (no lie) on my beautiful tan. (I am fair skinned with blonde hair). No one ever can believe that it is from a product.",1
Banana Boat sunless gradual tanning lotion goes on easily and looks great. This is a great alternative to tanning beds.,0
"I have tried dozens of self tanner's, BB self tanner is simply the best, tan's evenly looks natural and is priced very well.",0
"I am very pale and had skin cancer, this product provides a nice tan look that starts instantly and darkens with each application, allowing me to have a tan look through summer so I can wear capris and shorts",1
"I love this Product! Please do not change a thing, as far as, performance. It could use a little scent upgrade, maybe more of a summery tropical or coconut smell, but either way I will continue to use this product. It has a great selling price point considering the quality of tan you get from using this product. I get many complements on my tan and when I tell people I use a self-tanning lotion and its a Banana Boat product rather than a high dollar, can only order from the internet product, they are floored. Thank you for this wonderful product and my skin thanks you too. I believe most people, including myself, feel good when they have that summery, non-orange, glow, but feel guilty when getting it from the sun or a tanning booth. I can now enjoy that glow without the orange, without the guilt, and without hurting my skin. :-)",1
"I love it!! I've tried so many others and they are no match. This goes on natural looking. Just use a dry cloth to wipe knees, toes, around ankles and the back of legs behind knees after you rub it in. I have got alot of compliments with this... most people can't beleive its not real. It blends in with my natural skin tone. I get so aggravated when I go to a store and they have every brand but this one. And btw: the lotion is much better than the spray. Don't stop selling. The best!! thus far!!",0
"This is by far the best self tanner I've ever used...and I've used A LOT. Smells great, easy to apply, and natural looking color. Only thing is I can't find in any stores this year, I really hope it's not discontinued. I was so excited to see it on Walmart.com that I ordered 4 bottles! Banana Boat please continue making this product, it's amazing!!",0
"Just the right color, not too dark for my light skin! The key is to use a little at a time and follow directions. The sad thing is I ordered several different items from the same department. What a shame you didn't mail more products at one time! Several products came one at a time! WHAT a waste of money!",0
"I have tried multiple self-tanners (being extremely pale yet at extra high risk for skin cancer because of my family background) and this is the absolute ONLY one I've found worth blinking about! Be cautious around knees, elbows, and heels, etc. but besides that it is GREAT!",0
I love this stuff. I get such a natural looking tan that will last about a week. I highly recomend!!,0
"I cannot express how much I love this product. I used to be a heavy tanning bed user, but I stopped for my skins sake and have struggled to find a product that gives me a deep natural looking tan. This self tanner is amazing, it gets me darker than using the tanning bed ever did and with no sun damage or worrying about aging! The color is so deep and natural looking that people actually ask me if I've started using the tanning bed again when I use this. It doesn't streak and isn't orange and isn't greasy or sticky. I absolutely adore this self tanner and I always recommend it to my friends.",1
"I did some research before settling on this particular brand and I am so happy that I did. The reviews placed Banana Boat tanner on a top ten list. It doesn't turn orange on my skin and does a great job at moisturizing. I couldn't find the product at my store, so I just ordered on line and had it in 2 days! Love it.",1
"I have very fair skin so one application takes that paleness out of my skin and looks natural. This works great for build-up color too. Every new application brings added color. In the summer I will mix the Dark and Medium to obtain a deeper darker tan. If you're shopping around, definitely buy this. If you're not sure about the color buy both the Medium and Dark. You can't go wrong! I have tried almost everything on the market and this by far is the best! The scent is nice for a self-tanning lotion too.",1
"I purchased the deep dark color since the store I was shopping was out of the light/medium, but I was so happy that I did! The color looks great and gives a nice, natural tan (not orange). It goes on like a lotion so it doesn't leave streaks. I have tried other products like L'oral and Clinique, but I prefer Banana Boat for the price, pleasant smell, and quality!",1
This is by far the best self tanner on the market. I've tried so many - from expensive designer brands to generic - and I am very happy with this product!,1
Nothing works like this. Have problem finding it.,1
Love this product again. I stopped using it for awhile and used more expensive brands that people rave about they were okay. Finally decided to try banana boat again and it worked awesome Im tan not orange no streaking at all . Just wish they would make it in a mousse formula. That would be my only suggestion,1
"I love this tanning lotion ! people always ask about my beautiful tan, I have used it year round for many years. Thanks bananaboat, Helen",1
I've been using this deep dark color for a few years now. It is the best I have tried. Will continue to use it. It gives me the glow I need.,1
its the only self tanner ive ever liked and can use on my sensitive skin,1
I use it every other day after a shower. Make sure it is dried before you get dressed. I love it and people have asked me where I went on vacation.,1
This gives you a nice color with the really bad smell! Didn't make me orange or have weird spots! Follow the director and you should be fine! I use Banana Boat Tanning oil and Tanning Spray! Love all 3! Gets you tan in one night!,0
"I have been using this product for over 10 years. It started as a quick-fix tanning solution. I loved the way the smooth texture glided over my face. Ten years later and I am still using it daily and year round. I am 57 years old and have been told I look like I'm in my mid 40's!!! Thank you Banana Boat, for keeping it simple... Who'd of thought!! )",1
"This product is amazing. I had a ridiculously white belly and the rest of my body was tan! I was going to the beach and 2 days and just the sun alone couldn't help me get a tan that fast. So, I went online and read about this product. I went to wal-mart and decided to try it out for myself. And truthfully, this product works wonders! It adjusted to my skin tone and it didn't make me look orange. My belly actually matched the rest of my body for once. It took one application to notice a difference. It's so simple and easy to use too! Seriously folks, if you need a tan on one part of your body then use this. It works best if you apply it more then one time, but you can notice a difference immediately. It works wonders. Buy this is you need a good tan!",0
i got this product and it went on really well...i got the deep dark color....after applying 3 hours later i was dark..but in a good way it looked like ive been on the beach and got a good tan....,0
"After reading many positive reviews, I decided to give this product a go. I had an extremely pale belly and legs. After only one application, my skin has a tan. I absolutely love it and will continue to use.",0
"I have been a sun worshiper for hears. Nothing makes you feel better or more self-confident than a natural tan. I purchased this product, and I have tried several thru the years. I have never gotten a more natural result. More compliments, or more questions as to where I went on vacation to get that tan! Don't change one blessed thing. With a busy professional work schedule, no time for the salon or beach per say, this is by far, the best product I have ever used in my years of self tanning. Keep up the GREAT and AWESOME work!!",1
"I have used this product year around to keep a nice summer glow for 10 years, often i have people ask if I've been some where warm to get a tan and after they find out it's a lotion tan they're suprised. As long as you follow a few tips this it works great. I mostly use it on my face, When I use it on my face but i use a qtip to wipe excess around just the outside of my nostrils, on my eyebrows and along my hairline. When i use it on my body i apply it where you would normally get sun (ex the top of your arm) and blend it with plain lotion around dry areas of skin, especially the hands, feet and elbows. If you're applying to your arms and hands wash just your palms and inside of your fingers after applying with soap and lightly dry the tops of your hands and knuckles with a towel then use plain lotion on your palms and underside of wrist and blend for best effect.",0
I will never another self tanner unless I cannot find BB . I use the light medium and it is perfect for my fair skin. Just enough color for a natural look. Sometimes it's hard to find though. The very best on the market!,1
Goes on great and streak free. Natural color without baking in the sun. Not greasy and skin feels smooth . Nice summer color.,1
"I tried this out at the beginning of last summer because I was working alot and didn't really have the time to get tan-ready. The first time I used it, I used too much on my ankles and knees, so they looked kind of dirty. But the dirty effect wears off in a day or two. I absolutely love this product and it gives me an amazing tan color! I only use it about once week, (twice if i want to look a little darker) and it has lasted me quiet a long time! So I think it is a great deal and you really get a natural looking tan everytime!",0
I have used this product year-round for a couple of years. I use it on my face/neck only and it adds just a touch of color. Perfect!,1
"I really like this gentle cleanser - works great for my dry skin in the winter. Has absolutely no scent, and definitely is a gel/cream cleanser (doesn't foam) and I love that it comes in this handy travel size.",0
Works just fine.,0
Fresh and clean face,0
Love it.,0
I was recommended this by my dermatologist when my skin was breaking out and I was on two different topical treatments that dried out my skin and made it peel. This is probably the most gentle cleanser you can find on the whole market and it leaves your skin feeling super soft and no residue left behind. Whenever my skin starts getting dried out and sensitive to other products I always use this until it's back to normal and makes the uncomfortable healing process much more pleasant. This in conjunction with the lotion is a miracle. Highly recommend if in need for something gentle and effective,1
Love Cetaphil Skin Cleanser leaves your face clean soft.,0
Nice Product,0
It made a lot of my hair fall out and now instead of sleek my hair looks oily. I absolutely love other Suave products but this one just didn't cut it.,1
"Poor, I think there might be a bad batch out there. Product loses it's viscosity after a few weeks, becoming a watery mess",1
I want a shampoo that will make my curly hair come back to life.,1
Hi i love this line used since high school. I just bought a new set and it smells different. Should I be concerned or was their a change in suave sleek,1
I used to love the sleek and shine shampoo and conditioner but the last few time I bought it it smelled like I was putting developer in my hair ... Super strong smell of chemical I thought maybe I got a bad batch but the last two bottles I've bought have that scent of chemical to it .... Very disappointed,1
"I was excited to purchase this specific formula from Suave since I've always had problems with frizz and unruly hair. After using it the first time, it left a horrible waxy build up and my hair was dull. I changed the amounts of shampoo and conditioner but hair kept coming out the same. Love the scent but hated the way it left my hair. I'm rather disappointed. :(",1
The shampoo did not smell quite as bad as the conditioner. The conditioner smells like tire cleaner. I had a friend smell them and she was disgusted too. The package was in plastic wrap so I could not smell before I purchased. My hair fell out too. Very disappointed.,1
I had been using this product off and on for a couple of years and I really loved it. Loved the way it smelled and the way my hair felt. A few months ago I bought it again. This time after the first 2-3 days my scalp became dry and itchy. It was so itchy that I just wanted to scrape my scalp right off. Caused sores on my head that were also very itchy. I began to notice my hairbrush filling up with hair. Was cleaning out every week because my hair was falling out. I thought I had just become allergic to the shampoo and conditioner so I gave it to my daughter. Her and her boyfriend began to use it and their scalps became dry and severely itchy. Suave must have changed the formula. They need to pull this product off the shelves and revamp it. Maybe before selling it again the head honchos should taker it home and use it themselves as well as their families. Then they might be more careful about what they are putting on the shelves for the consumer. Please beware if you use this your head will itch like you have never felt an itch before.,1
I bought this product and at first i was content with the product. My hair felt clean and fresh but after a few uses i noticed my scalp getting dry and itchy. When i looked at the roots of my hair i noticed the product was burning my scalp and it was peeling!!!.. i stopped using this product and went back to using head and shoulders which i should have never left to try Suave. My scalp is now healing since i moved back. Never again will i use this product that is too harsh.,1
"I have to say, Suave Professionals Sleek Conditioner for dry or frizzy was the best conditioner I've ever had. It was super affordable and everyone says I smell nice (which is pretty creepy) But, these past 2 days, I noticed something different. The color was different, it felt different, it smelled different, and it wasn't working anymore. I even thought someone was pranking me. So, I decided to search up the old ingredients and compare it to the current conditioner I have. The formula was different. Who ever is responsible for changing the ingredients, PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK! . I really don't want to find a new conditioner because it's so much work. I will change my review to an positive as long as someone does something about the formula.",1
"My daughter has soft 3b to 3c curls. This product dried her hair so bad that it matted and it took days of oil treatments to get it back to close to normal. My youngest girl had softer wavy hair and this dried her ends. It split them. After the conditioner was rinsed out her ends looked horrible. I came to suave.com for more info and help getting my money back. But I kept getting directed to the home page. I love most Suave products, but this one was a sure miss for us.",1
Bought the sleek shampoo and conditioner. Opened them this evening to wash my daughters hair and it was as though someone has dumped them BOTH out and filled with water! Highly dissatisfied with these products!,1
"I like the way it smells and my hair feels nice after its blow drie however, my hair feels super waxy and oily after half a day.. I tried using less conditioner and same result. I might end up using the shampoo only which is a waste of buying the conditioner.",1
"I bought suave sleek shampoo and used it for about a month, i diddnt like the way the shampoo made my hair feel, like a waxy feeling all over and the conditioner is thick and works decently..i wouldn't recommend the shampoo.",1
"I tried this conditioner along with the shampoo, expecting it to make my hair smoother less frizzy. If anything it did the opposite.",1
"My wife and I have used Suave Professional shampoos and conditioners for many years. We have always really liked how they worked and consider them the best value available when it comes to shampoo and conditioner. However, the Sleek product that is similar to Matrix caused my scalp to break out in severe acne. I didn't realize it was the the shampoo. Nothing I tried helped and it kept getting worse. I finally stumbled on various comments online when I was doing research trying to figure out what was causing my problem that indicated Matrix caused them a similar problem. I immediately changed shampoos and ten days later, my scalp is almost completely clear. Will go back to the other Suave Professional products as their is something in this product that my body reacts to negatively.",1
I have been using this product for 2 years! I have always and still do love the feeling of my hair from this product and I've always loved the smell it had always stayed my hair until recently as soon as I get out of the shower the scent is gone.. If they could make the scent a bit stronger to stay into my hair longer that would be amazing but other than that it's a great product! :),1
Really like this line especially to be a store shampoo. It does help the hair with straightness. The conditioner is detangling. I have lots of movement using this line especially followed by a light glaze and flat-ironing.,1
"I have very, very long hair (about 28 inches worth), and I've always been a little bit of a shampoo snob, but I was in between shampoos and just ran into the drug store to get something and just happened pick this up. I was so impressed by it! After using this shampoo only once, my hair was incredibly smoother and felt stronger! However, there was one really bad thing about this shampoo + conditioner, and it's the conditioner!!! It stinks!! It literally smells like rotten wet dog, it is so atrocious. Luckily the scent doesn't last long after you get out of the shower, but it makes the washing experience feel dirty. The shampoo smells good, but that conditioner...who thought of that scent",1
"I used this shampoo and conditioner for a couple of years when my typical brand kept altering their line of products. They worked pretty well and who can complain about a big old bottle of shampoo for less than 3 My hair had gotten really damaged from being permanently straightened and additional heat damage which is the only reason I switched back when they finally seemed to get things together again. Unfortunately I needed something more moisturizing plus I also believe they changed the scent of the shampoo from a mild clean scent to a tropical one which was a turn off for me. But still was very happy with this line, would recommend it for anyone without very damaged hair.",1
Love save products,1
"I have naturally curly hair, and it frizzes up easily. I use the conditioner as a co-wash and a leave-in. My hair is soft and manageable whenit dries. I absolutely love the conditioner!!",1
I receive comments almost daily on how shiny and healthy my hair looks and feels. I have converted many friends and my husband to use suave sleek!,1
First off my hair is straight I use this and my hair always gets attention! and it feels so soft!,1
"Love these products, make my hair look great! Also love the prices.",1
I loveeeeeeeee this shampoo/conditioner it's really great.,1
I loooove this shampoo and conditioner its the best!!,1
Sleek line really helps control frizz for curly wavy hair. The conditioner also helps De-tangle hair. Thanks Suave for making your products affordable. I would definitely recommend Suave.,1
"Besides the Suave Coconut shampoo and conditioner this is the only product I'll use for my daughter's thick, curly hair. Comes out the shower perfect every time! My mother spends lots of money on hair products and none have worked as well as Suave! Highly recommended",1
"I have very thick, course, porous hair that is one length to help control it. My hair soaks up any moisture. Giving me either an itchy tangly afro or lion's mane. I look horrible with short hair. It sticks out and turns my hair from lions mane onto a hedgehog style. I tried Suave Smooth and Sleek and I am happy. It makes my hair soft. It feels clean and not greasy or tacky. Please don't stop making this product!",1
"My 11 yr old daughter recently began using this product on her waist length, thick hair. After her second use the change was amazing. Before this product it would take an agonizing hour to comb out her hair, many tears were shed due to all of the tangles. But now, we are finished within 10 minutes, no tears involved. Thank you so much on behalf of both my daughter myself. Please don't ever stop making this product.",1
I'm one of those people who has tried everything to get the damaged straw-like feeling out of my hair. I have thick hair so between the damage from heating and the frizz from humidity I was feeling hopeless..until I found an affordable alternative to the overpriced salon shampoo.. suave sleek has changed my hair completely. It has went from dry to smooth and soft in one week. I finally found one that works!,1
It is An Awesome Shampoo Conditioner it leaves My Hair Shiny Manageable Smelling good and it detangles it!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"Usually by the time I would leave my house for work, my hair would already frizz up and out and everywhere !! I have yet found a shampoo/conditioner that would actually hold up all day, until I tried Suave-Sleek. I absolutely LOVE this product. after just one wash it was instant results and it smells really good. When I got home that evening my hair was still smooth!! Thank ya'll so much !!",1
I love the way this shampoo/conditioner makes my hair feel. I have had 3 different ladies who have washed my hair at the salon comment on how good my hair feels and ask what I have been using. I worked in a salon for a while and bought professional products with my discount but I keep coming back to the Sleek. It is definitely a great product at a great price!,1
"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this shampoo and conditioner. I wasn't expecting much for the low price, but it smelled -and worked- as well as some of the more expensive salon quality brands I have used in the past. I have naturally straight hair, and this helped to smooth and straighten even more. Everyone always says my hair smells really good too!",1
They took it off the shelves and now I can not find it anywhere. It was the only brand that was working on my hair. Please put it back on the shelves. My hair really needs it. Suave shampoo/conditioner dry or frizzy ///////////no keratin,1
"This is some really good shampoo/conditioner my hair was fizzy, dry, damaged, and very hard to comb, but when I started using these products my hair became silky, smooth, easy to comb, soft, and more healthier. I love this stuff I also use the sleek anti-frizz cream for fizz and heat protection.",1
"I have long, curly hair that has become dry and frizzy with age. Being very particular about what I use on my hair I was amazed at how wonderful the conditioner is. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants a tangle-free, silky smooth solution for coarse/dry hair. Thank you Suave!",1
I switched to Suave Sleek Shampoo Conditioner a few months ago after using Matrix's Smooth Sleek exclusively for the last 10 years. It's been a seamless breakup with Matrix! I'm now a big fan of the Suave product that works just as well as a fraction of the price!,1
"My hair is naturally straight but with quite a bit of frizz which gets worse during summertime on the East Coast because of the humidity. Plus, with the color treatment that I regularly let my hair suffer from, frizz has always been an issue for me. Of course there are ways to control it, such as by using oils, treatment cream, and even hair spray none of which I'm all that crazy about as often times they irritate my skin as they are applied after a wash and remain on the hair for the rest of the day. Then came the Suave Sleek series.. Not only the consistency of the product feel expensive, the first time I used the shampoo, I didn't even feel the need to use the conditioner as it already felt so smooth. The scent is great, and they really do help with the frizz, a lot. I don't even brush my hair anymore because it feels so great. No tangles, just straight, soft, smooth hair. Really worth trying especially considering the price! Can't beat that. Highly recommended! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
My hair after during a long rough day I feel excellent This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I love how smooth of my hair is it's not as dry as it used to be I think this shampoo helps my hair better than the others,1
Product works wonders on my curly hair! I'd recommend it to anyone with curly hair.,1
"After a couple of uses of the Sleek shampoo and conditioner I noticed a big difference in my hair! I noticed great shine and strength and the frizz has calmed down even in the NYC summer humidity! I find that a little goes a long way with the conditioner which is great! If your in need of more frizz control, use more of the conditioner. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
Love these products!! My curly color-treated hair has never looked and felt better!!,1
My hair is naturally curly and very thick and dry. I went to the store to buy something reasonably priced because I was on a budget. I got the sleek and smooth because my hair is outta control. I washed it and waited a little while to dry my hair. It took 10 mins to dry and wasn't dry and frizzy when I was done like it usually is when using other products,1
I only use the Shampoo Suave Sleek and its the Best. After Im done shampooing I go ahead and grab my Suave Essentials Coconut Conditioner. it is the Best Combination possible. I have hair Growth and less Hair fall. I see no Hairs in my Tub thank Suave. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I absolutely love this shampoo ! It has made my hair so soft and smooth. It's a real bargain. I use it all the time, plus it doesn't make my scalp itch like so many shampoos do.",1
Works like the most expensive shampoo but at a lot less. Great product!,1
"I have curly unruly hair, and Suave Sleek and Shine makes it unbelievably soft. With little to no fly aways. Grateful for the affordable price and quality!!!",1
"I love this shampoo! Years ago, I was having so many problems with my hair. It was NOT growing, falling out, unmanageable and my hot tools were just breaking my hair in half. I decided to try this product because it contained ingredients I had used before with another favorite product that was discontinued. Using this shampoo has brought my hair back to life again! It's shiny, long and manageable. Goodbye split ends, HELLO HEALTHY HAIR!",1
Texture not quite what I've had in other brands. Used it on top of a salad. Slightly fishy smell. Yes it's white tuna. Just not the best part of the fish. I would not use it for tuna salad sandwiches. Probably be okay in a casserole or cooked dish.,1
I've had premium tuna in a can and this was not even close.,1
Tuna is good. Not cheap though.,1
"This is the only tunI buy. If you are a tuna fan this one is the one. Nice white tuna, no fishy smell or taste.",1
"I had 2 cans of tuna. One was Bumble Bee the other was a different brand (Brand S). I was making lunch for my husband I (Tuna on toast) and decided to do a taste test of both brands. I found that the Bumble Bee had a better flavor and it was dry like Brand S. I know that sounds funny hearing that a tuna packed in water is dry but I think you know what it's like when you have meat or fish that is dry tastes like it was overcooked. Well, that wasn't the case for Bumble Bee. It also looked better in the can. I will buy Bumble Bee from now on.",1
I do not like tuna. That being said this is the only kind I will eat because it does not taste or smell like tuna.,1
I love Bubble Bee. ...great for quick lunches. Price is just right for my family. ...thanks again,1
"This tuna is flavorable in sandwiches, salads or casseroles.",1
"This was a wonderful flavorful tuna. Nice flakey texture, a great taste.",1
I use this for stains on carpet (pet and kid) works great so far.,1
Best tortillas in the world.,1
Awesome movie. It was very entertaining. Dont know if I can top it.,1
Good but there was a missing part. Had to get an extra screw to install.,1
I love these lights they fit just perfect over the Pegasus medicine cabinet we mounted will buy again when we do extra bath,1
Exactly like the site shows it and described it. Very happy with the product. Will buy more items to match.,1
Wanted to love this but it's a bit too heavy for me. I have mild psoriasis and this seemed to make it itch more���I think it's the argan oil - must be allergic.,1
I have thick coarse hair and for me this just worked ok. It did not smooth as much as other products I have tried. It has a scent that is acceptable.,1

"I actually really enjoy this conditioner. Have tried a whole bunch, both expensive and cheap. I have thick, curly and dry hair so I'm pretty particular about what I use. Smell is nice! I used it with the Moisturizing unscented shampoo and feel like the combo of the two is keeping my hair very healthy. I've also noticed less frizz as well. I've only used it a couple times but I only wash my hair once ever 4-5 days or so. Scalp isn't greasy and hair isn't dried out. Curls aren't too frizzy either!",1
It made my hair super soft and shiny. Left it manageable too. Smells good without being overpowering.,1
"This product cannot be improved upon... even the scent is wonderful not overpowering and very fresh. After having grown my hair long this was the only product so far, that would adequately restore moisture and detangle without residue. I even recommend it for a pet grooming conditioner after shampoo... Everyone that pets my dog cannot get over how soft she is and already 12 years old.... safe for pets as mine is doing great using it for about 8 months now.",1
This is a great product. I really like the scent. It works very well in my hair.,1
Leaves my hair soft and shiny and smells nice too.,1
Great conditioner. Have not used this scent yet. Seaweed Bath Company makes a awesome conditioner. ALL of their products are A+++++!,1
"This shelf made of cardboard. The assemble system is just double stick tape, It should not be more than { $ }dollars. it Just looks so cheap.",1
I got this for my 1 year old daughters room to place fabric bins in. When I recived it the backing was cardboard and the shelves are held together by 3m tape and cardboard pegs. Very cheap looking. I paid way to much for the quality of product. Product is not very sturdy. Very poor prooduct.,1
The major connections are made with double stick tape. There are no screws to hold the components together. I will be returning this purchase.,1
"We like this shelf, and found it relatively easy to assemble. The assembly directions aren't really complete, but if you've gotten familiar with the companies website it's pretty easy to figure out. Overall, it looks nice, suits our needs, and we're happy to know it's formaldehyde free. Shipping did cause a little damage to the item (dented in a few areas) but it didn't affect it's functionality and I honestly kind of expected it, given that the product is made of recycled paper, which makes the material pretty soft. It probably won't last forever, but that's okay. We're happy to have it for now and to know that it won't expose our new baby or us to any concerning formaldehyde.",1
This 3-shelf bookcase is perfect for any small space that you want to make useful. The assembly is by far the easiest I have ever encountered. The bookshelf looks really authentic and is super stable.,0
"""Easy to assemble...lightweight....yet seems sturdyHome to sewing supplies, portable machine is on BOTTOM shelf, just in case!So far, so goodBegan with two Way basics products, now own five......Love the clean look, extra storage space!""",1
This 3-shelf bookcase is perfect for any small space that you want to make useful. The assembly is by far the easiest I have ever encountered. The bookshelf looks really authentic and is super stable.,1
"I will be going away to college soon and I was looking for some simple but attractive shelving options. These are it! Assembly was VERY easy and it took me less than fifteen minutes to put it together. They seem sturdy as they can hold up to my massive manga and book collections. I plan on ordering more of these. One of the nicest features is that you can choose and build these shelves to fit in the space that you need to fill. They are easy to customize by putting them together to suit your taste. The different color choices are great too! I highly recommend these shelves. They look great, they are easy and fast to put together, they are reasonably priced, they are sturdy, and they help the environment. What more could a person ask for?",1
"When I got my product, I was able to assemble it quickly and the tape was really strong. I moved my cube across the room pretty easily and let it set overnight. The cube has been a lifesaver! My clutter is finally gone! I just hope I remember to put my things away... old habits",1
"just received the 2 shelf,and i must admit it looks great. Easy instructions, no tools at all...just a knife to open the box. Peel off the tape and the adhesive is very strong. Great purchase.",1
"In small old houses, there's just not that much room to put the necessary things such as bookcases. Luckily I found this because it fits almost anywhere and looks good. I almost had to resort to milk crates.. Glad I waited and found this.",1
The All Purpose Cleaner arrived quickly and intact. It did work well but I seemed to have a reaction to it. So I probably would not purchase again. If you do not have allergies /sensitivity the cleaner works great.,1
"Bought this product with the 32 oz refill bottle of same product. Works great on normal cleaning but I have not used it on any ""challenging"" cleaning. Citrus scent is nice.",1
Good all purpose spray,0
Love this product and the fact that it's not toxic. It cleans counter tops very well. It also works in the sink.,1
I love the fact that this doesn't have any chemicals in it.,1
Love all the Biokleen product-line. This one is also great. Cleans very well,1
"Cleans well and smells great -- fresh and natural as opposed to chemical. I use it to clean everything from the bathroom sink to my car interior. Like all products in the Biokleen line, this one works well and is non-toxic.",1
"Love this cleaner. Since discovering it a few years ago, it is now the only cleaner we use in our household. It cleans just about everything, yet it is mild on the skin,",1
"I was not impressed with this product at all, could of used the shampoo and gotten the same results. I was anticipating a prominent original carrot smell and it was lacking. Nourishing I think not!",1
I am pretty disappointed with this body wash. It does not lather well and does not leave the skin feeling clean. I also don't like the smell. I have to use a lot of the wash to get a good lather. Will not buy gain.,1
"I just used this for the first time. It smells great, and was feeling great until I got to my tender bits. Holy wow! Will not do that again. .ow ow ow. Also, they really mean it when they say do not get near your eyes! Packaging has some issues. The top is not attached to the bottle, which made me end up playing catch the lid. Very much like that it's not slippery/slimy like some competitors' comparable product. I love all the other Yes To products I've tried. I think as long as I don't use this on my face and bits, I will like this one, too.",1
The plastic is soooo dang hard on this bottle that u almost have 2 squeeze the bottle with 2hands... outta line. How can u enjoy a good shower if ur constantly fighting with a bottle of product that suppose 2b nourishing n relaxn. Because of this design flaw i cannot rate any higher. Fix this problem right away. Oh and for the rec'd. i did remove the xtra clear tape on the bottle before use so that had nothing to do with it as some ppl complained.,1
"I love treating my skin with body wash and body lotions. I am always trying to keep my skin feeling smooth and looking healthy. I use to get a lot of dryness, especially in the winter but not so much since I been moisturizing more and more each day. I love the way this product makes my skin feel. I just wish it lather and made more suds. But overall I like the way it smells, it's got a very soft scent. It seems to work better when used with the daily moisture carrot body lotion. It leaves a nice smell on my skin and leaves my skin very soft.",1
"This is supposed to be a hydrating/moisturizing body wash. I've been using it for about 3 wks now, and can honestly say I have notice no change in my skin. The smell is a little strange, but not bad. I'd say in par with the rest of Yes products. My bottle top did arrive broken, which is irritating as I had to modify a brand new bottle inorder to get the product to come out. Yes needs to do a much better job with packaging.",1
"Love love love this shower gel! It smells amazing and works so well! Shipping took forever though and I think the cap to the bottle is busted because its really hard to squeeze and the gel comes out really slow. Its kind of a chore.. (unless that's how they make all the bottles in which case, poor product construction)",1
"Very minimal scent, a little goes a long way. I have well water so no matter how good, I still need a lot of moisturizer post shower. For the price, ingredients, and overall performance, I would recommend.",1
This product is great! Our only problem is that we can't get the cap to dispense any soap. We end up removing the whole lid. We have the same problem with other soaps with same type of lid.,1
A little goes a long way. This product lathers well and I love that my children can use this product and be safe from harmful chemicals.,1
"I love it!!! The smell is great, the gel leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated. I do agree with other reviewers- it is difficult to squeeze the gel out of the bottle. However, I have discovered that leaving the bottle the right way up (not upside down), actually makes the squeezing much easier. I am happy to have found this gel I have very sensitive skin prone to allergies, and have not had any problems with it. Will buy it again!",0
It smooths dry skin . Great all over body wash. Ladies u know what I mean.,0
Yes to... ANYTHING is my favorite. And I won't buy anything else... I'm a bit obsessed :),0
"I love this product! At first my skin was blotchy when I used it but after a week or two I found that went away and I was so pleased. It was the no animal testing that brought me to Yesto but it is the products, like this one, that are making me stay! Pros: Best smell! Great formula Nourishing Moisturizing Clean but not dry feeling after use Cons: Slightly irritating at first Worst cap! I have to take it off every time Have to use more than I would like for full body Overall it is a great purchase and I will be buying over and over again!",1
"I am an avid shower gel person and have shopped for the perfect shower gel for years --- I have finally found it. The fragrance is to die for, the feel is amazing in the shower, and afterwards I never have dry skin. The price is completely in line for the product and it is easy to find in most stores. I can't say enough how much I LOVE this product. PLEASE don't ever change anything about it!!!",1
"I just love this product. I started with yes to ... by using their face products. Then I discovered their hair en body products. This showergel is so soft for the skin, the smell is amazing and I don't have any allergic reactions. Use it with a puff sponge and you can do twice as long with the product. The huge bottle is a big advantage as well. I will definitely buy this again.",1
"This Yes to Carrots shower gel is incredible! I loved it immediately and can't stop using it. The price is great for the size bottle you get and it goes a long way when used with a body wash loofah sponge. I'm still on my first bottle that I purchased nearly 2 months ago! Amazing product, already bought a second bottle when it was on sale for when this one runs out.",1
"This carrot shower gel was the first product I ever used from the Yes To line and it converted me forever! I have been using it for 3 years now. I have sensitive, and frequently dry skin and this body wash always leaves it feeling healthy. The scent is not overpowering but is enough to wash away the stench of the day! By far my favorite body wash ever.",1
"I started using this product on a suggestion from my Doctor for my extremely dry skin on my legs....he said his wife used it and loved it. It really did the trick, no more dry legs. It makes your skin feel so soft. I really like the fragrance of it, as my Husband has a reaction to a lot of different smells. I have been using it for several years.",1
"I suffer from Psoriasis, and started using the shower gel about a year ago. My skin does a little happy dance every day now because it is smoothed and soothed by this wonderful gel. It truly does hydrate my skin, which can be painfully dry, and has a wonderful scent as a bonus. Thank you for this wonderful product!",1
"I love the fragrance of this body wash I have used it for a long time and each purchase is consistent, which is not always true of the yes to carrots lotions and creams as far as the smell. I never have a problem with dry skin using this body wash even in the winter. Would recommend this product",1
"I have always had a problem with body washes leaving a filmy feel to my skin. With yes to carrots, my skin feels soft and smooth and like it can breath. I live in the south and I stay hot and sticky in the summer. But this summer I plan on using this everyday as long as it keeps helping my skin.",1
"As someone with eczema, I have to be careful about what soaps/body washes to use because most of them dry my skin out even more. But this shower gel doesn't dry my skin out at all, in fact it moisturizes as I use it! I don't even need to use lotion most days after my shower. Huzzah!",1
"Just the right amount of moisturizing effect without any residue feeling. Feels great on your skin, lathers like crazy and smells nice too. What more can you ask for Stop the search now and try this one out. I have the grapefruit and the cucumber but this is my FAV.",1
"I love everything about this product! I love the smell, the consistency, and how well it works on my skin. It's nice to know that I'm using nourishing, healthy stuff on my body! I absolutely love this product and I will be buying it again in the future",1
"The Yes to Carrots Hydrating Shower Gel is fabulous and a must have for anyone who wants to indulge in a luxurious shower/bath! Your skin is refreshed and moisturized. I love the light, sweet smelling fragrance and it is a healthy treat for your skin!",1
"Excellent product. Smells wonderful. Actually wish the fragrance was stronger. One criticism is the packaging - it is very difficult to squeeze the body wash out of the bottle. A pump would be much better, or at least an improved larger opening.",1
"I don't have particularly sensitive skin, but body washes can make me itchy. YT carrots didn't do that! It lathers up to where you barely need to use any on your scrubby. As a vegan, I'm happy to find affordable cruelty free products!!!!",1
"Unlike a majority of Yes To products this is massive. I used the cucumber wash before this and I love them both equally. My skin is very sensitive and will dry out quickly with the wrong product, but both of these are fantastic.",1
"This has to be the best natural body wash for the price point on the market. It moisturizes your skin without it feeling oily, lathers well and a little will go a long way, PLUS it smells like carrots, which I love.",1
"From the first time I tried it I was HOOKED! It feels so pure and nourishing...and smells grrrreat! It has a great lather and moisturizes wonderfully, (no more dry winter skin...ever!) I highly recommend it.",1
"This is my absolute favorite shower gel! It foams up wonderfully and smells amazing! It leaves my skin feeling clean yet very moisturized. It has a light, clean scent that smells great on men and women.",1
This is the best shower gel I have found. It has such a wonderful fragrance and makes your skin feel wonderful too! I love the fact also that the ingredients are not harmful and the price is great too!,1
"I've finally found a mild yet effective product that can moisturize with irritating my really sensitive skin. The scent is mild and pleasant, and the feel of the shower gel is silky.",1
This shower gel makes my skin is all glowy and soft. Love that it is simple and not too scented. Can't wait to alternate between Yes to Carrots and Yes to Cucumbers for the summer!,1
"This body soap is a must have! It lathers great and smells amazing! It leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized. This is my go to soap - especially in the winter,",1
"Smells great, feels creamy, and is really moisturizing! It works wonder for my skin in the winter. It even cleared up some back-acne I had, and it's not even for acne!",1
"Feels great on my winter-weary skin! My skin was feeling so dry and itchy, but Carrots Hydrating Shower Gel has certainly made it feel more moisturized and soothed.",1
This body wash is very moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and have never had an issue with this gel. It rinses away very cleanly and leaves my skin feeling fresh.,1
"I use this on both myself and my little dog. Her hair gets a perfect balance of clean and moisturized, and she smells great for a long time. Not just for humans!",1
"This product is awesome! I have bumps on my arms and legs, I noticed while using this they became smaller and less noticeable. I absolutely love this body wash!",1
This body wash is thorough and gentle in every way. I especially like that the scent is light as I am sensitive to perfumes and I truly can enjoy this scent.,1
"I love love love this product! Leaves my skin really soft with out the filmy residue. And the scent is light and fresh! For sure, going to continue buying!",1
This soap is so foamy and luxurious! I love how silky smooth the lather is and it keeps my skin moisturized. I use it for bubbles in my son's bath too.,1
"This bodywash lives up to it's name and is very moisturizing but leaves your skin feeling clean. Plus, the bottle is huge so it lasts forever.",1
My skin is much softer now after using the body wash. I only use paraben free products. And a small amount goes a long way!,1
"I really like the fresh smell of this. Almost like baby powder or fabric softener. Also, love the large size of the bottle.",1
So concentrated and moisturizing. This product leaves my skin feeling so soft and it smells so good. I highly recommend it!!!,1
I have skin allergies and I have not had any problems with this product. It moisturizes my skin and leaves me feeling fresh.,1
Great fragrance for a delightful shower gel! I take a mini bottle with me when I travel. I highly recommend this product.,1
Love this product. I use it twice a day to keep my dry skin feeling looking great. I give as gifts to friends family.,1
"This produst is truly beautiful it helps with all cases,it smells great and most importantly its 98 natural....love it",1
"Love this product, definitely my permanent body wash. Leaves you feeling very soft. Skin looks healthy happy.",1
The carrot and tomato body washes are the only two body washes I use. They both smell great. Need I say more,1
"I used to have dry skin, but not anymore thanks to this shower gel. It's amazing.",1
This body wash is refreshing! A pleasant scent! Definitely recommend.,1
"My kids love it. I LIKe it, but wish it smelled better :)",1
Love the giant bottle. It bubbles up nicely and smells great!,1
"Love this body wash, it's very soothing and moisturizing.",1
I love this soap! It has a nice lather and lasts forever!,1
"I really like the carrot face moisturizer, so I thought I would try out the soap. I love it. LIke someone else said in their review, the soap doesn't want to come out of the top so I do have to unscrew the top to use the soap. It doesn't deter me buying this soap again in the future, but it could for other people who don't want or have time to always unscrew the top.",1
I absolutely love this shampoo and target has the lowest price on it. It leaves the hair smelling awesome!,1
"Believe it or not, the first time I purchased this body wash it was by mistake. I had mistaken it for the shampoo! I am so glad I made that mistake! Best body wash I have ever used! My skin has never felt so soft! I can't go back to using anything else!",1
"I'm very sensitive to fragrance - most give me migraines - and this product doesn't smell. At. All. I've always wanted to try this but the price can be intimidating when there is always the possibility that you just won't like it. I finally got to try it when another store was clearancing them out. The phrase ""Love It"" doesn't express enough about how wonderful this product is. Does it get you clean? Yep. Quite well. And I feeling all soft and pampered when I get out of the shower. And its great for guys too. My husband made fun of me when I first brought it home - I had some of the yes to baby carrots baby foam for our girls - and he just told me that he's been using my Yes To Carrots body wash and that he really, really likes it!",1
"Not all shower gels leave their smell after you use them This one does. I did not have the packaging shown here, but my top would not dispense the shower gel, so when I want to use it I have to take it all the way off, which is annoying. Other than that it is good and can't wait to try the rest of the line.",1
"I really like this body wash. It leaves your skin feeling nourished, soft and it smells great!",1
"I like this product. It is one of the few that controls my dry. frizzy hair without making my scalp itch. I bought it from Amazon because it is getting hard to find in stores. HOWEVER, I did not receive 3 shampoos, I received 1 shampoo and 2 conditioners! Even though this was not a set of three, but the one item ordered in a quantity of 3. Booo!",1
It is the best shampoo and it has so much that it'll do for your hair. Thank you for having . I've had to look everywhere to get this. Still have not found in my area.,1
"FINALLY! Thank you Alberto VO5 .. You finally got rid of Sodium lauryl sulfate the ingredient responsible for drying the hair out! Laureth is much better! I have very dry blonde curly hair, not thick but a lot of hair. This shampoo is excellent. does not dry out my hair.. leaves it clean. Wish it had the fresh scent of the split ends formula though. No matter though, it's great and I recommend it for those who have very dry hair.The conditioner is excellent! Detangles without too much help of a comb! Hair looks soft and shiny even after it's dry:) other shampoos(dove,Neutrogena triple moisture, Tressemme worked well in the beginning then my hair would feel like hay and it would feel sticky.Thank you... Now Alberto VO5 please remove the sodium lauryl sulfate in the shampoos that are color treated,that need moisture and I guarantee people will never say ..it dries my hair out.. Been using it for a week now.. And I'm in love with this! do not stop making it though!!",1
Movie is fine... But does not include Ultraviolet. Called customer service and I now have to wait for BB to reorder the dvd and I then have to go to UPS to return this copy. This $5 dvd is more like $20-$30 with the additional time I have had to waste and a trip to UPS. Not a good start to holiday shopping.,1
"IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE A 2DISC ITEM,,,THERE WAS ONLY ONE DISC IN THE CASE,AND THE CASE ONLY HAD A SPOT FOR ONE DVD.NOT 2! SO THEY COULD NOT HAVE PUT 2 DVD S IN THERE IF THEY WANTED TO! POOR MARKETING,EVEN MY RECEIPT SAID 2 DISC.SO I HAD TO WASTE MY GAS TO DRIVE BACK TO THE STORE TO RETURN IT TO GET THE SAME THING THAT ACTUALLY HAD 2 DISCS IN IT.THE ONE I PURCHASED WAS AT THE POTTSTOWN PA. STORE ,,MARYLAND EXCHANGED IT FOR ME!!!!",1
Did not like this movie. Wasted my money on this Blu Ray DVD set. Would not recommend this movie even if you are a true Johnny Depp fan.,1
"The preview leads you to believe it's a comedy. With Johnny Depp, I believed it would be good. About half way through, I realized it was not going to get funny. Every humorous scene was in the previews. I gave the disk to my daughter, and told her she could keep it........ she returned it to me the next day, and told me she didn't want it.",0
"Sorry but..... This movie is really bad from beginning to end. Bought it because I love Johnny Depp, but this is a total waste of $$ and time.",1
dont waste your time was more fun looking out the window watching leaves fall from the tree and have a trash can near you to through up in.,1
"Johnny Depp did a great job - he is a very talented actor, but in my opinion this movie fell short of my expectations. I didn't realize when I bought it that it was directed by Tim Burton until after. It's the typical weird off-the-wall scattered plot movie. It'd be a one star movie if Depp wasn't in it - he is the only reason the movie was at least bearable to me.",1
Not one of his best. I should have passed on this one.,1
"I love Johnny Depp in these weird roles, but this one fails to hit the mark. Not really a comedy or a horror flick. Its just lost in the middle.",1
"I was a fan of the original as a child. However, what was fun then is not quite as enjoyable as an adult. The movie is quirky, but that is not enough for me to recommend it. Rent it first.",1
Strange and familiar at the same time Johnny Depp plays Johnny Depp. Burton uses the same sexually repressed dark figure looking to get it in. See it only once and only if you rented it or if someone already owns it.,1
This version was too demonic for me. The dog even left the room because of some of the scenes.,1
"This movie wasn't as funny as expected, very boring.",1
"I liked it, but I didn't get pulled into the story. And the best jokes were told in the previews.",1
"If you saw the commercials for this movie, you saw all the funny parts of the movie. I was very disappointed in Depp being in a drawn out pretty boring movie. Borrow it, don't buy it IF YOU have to see it. I give this movie a 6.5 out 10.",1
A good fun movie with great music from the 70's; mindless fun for an afternoon.,1
"Good movie but could have been better. Not one of Depp's best roles, but he was the star of the show.",1
Good one time watch kind of movie!Johny Depp as always too good!,1
it wasn't as great as the original dark shadows but johnny depp is alright,1
Based on the soap opera of same name is a fun adaption of the show Johnny deep plays barnabs Collins who we cursed to be a vampire and he's all inIt's a really fun movie it's not a great flim but you have to consider this was a challenge to make because of how the show type of speaking had to transfer the big screen,1
Great light comedy. Could watch again and again. Recommended,1
It's not the best movie ever but definitely worth watching.,1
Silly movie but is generally pretty funny. I recommend.,1
Such a funny and intertaining Johnny depp movie....,1
This is a typical Tim Burton movie. Not bad and not his best. I got this on sale as well.,1
The movie had a comedic side to old day soap dark shadows . I enjoyed movie for it self but it seemed different to what I remember of the old show. Still enjoyed movie.,1
"This was not one of Johnny Depps best movies.Dont get me wrong his acting was spot on as always, but the movie itself surely lacked.It is worth watching I suppose, but it is no where near as funny as the commercials lead it out to be.It only had a few funny scenes to me, I dont know but the movie just really did not do it for me. It was ok to watch I guess but just not what I expected it to be.",1
"I just couldn't get into it, but my wife and daughter LOVE it. We do all agree that the soundtrack is great. (if you like music from many years ago, that is.)",1
...well I got it for my girlfriend and she likes it. I guess it was fun to watch,1
It was pretty good movie over all. Funny in parts. Not as good as the original one but a good movie over all.,1
Had some good laughs but overall not that great of a movie to me.,1
It's what you would expect from a Johnny Depp film.,1
An enjoyable film. Not Tim Burtons nor Johnny Depps' best.,1
"Johnny Depp was very good as usual and the rest of the cast was good, byt the story was strange",1
... I don't much care for it. It's not my preferred type of movie.,1
I was hoping to love this movie. It was a let down.,1
"Movie was not as expected, only purchased to add to my Tim Burton Collection.",1
Not the greatest Johnny Depp movie but it was ok I guess,1
"It was kind of silly and the dvd didn't perform to well..missed a part of the movie..however, I always enjoy Johnny Depp.",1
Good movie. A lot of humor as well as the things Johnny Depp does to make his movies what they are.,1
It's worth seeing one time perhaps but wouldn't buy again,1
The expectations exceeded the film. Depp was great as always but the story was weak and overall not worth the time.,1
It's like that so why not watch it with them .....,1
"Johnny Depp at his best as the head of fading family estate; oh and he happens to be a vampire. Filled with great jokes and interesting cast. A great movie for a rainy afternoon when you want something different from the usual movie fair. The more you watch it, the more you appreciate the subtlety of the humor. Looks like the cast had great fun filming.",1
A remember when video at a good price. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,1
Thought the movie was excellent. was well worth the money.,1
I am a big fan of Johnny Depp. Love all his movies. This was not one of his best but still funny.,0
"Good movie, fun and campy. Doesn't have much in common with the old tv series, but that's fine. We enjoyed it enough to watch it twice.",1
"We've been picking up bargain Blu-Rays waiting for 4K content and find that Best Buy has a great inventory, well organized and competitively priced. I dunno on this one-I like Johnny Depp but he's done better stuff.",1
its a blu ray. it was a fun movie. love johnny depp.,1
Not my favorite Depp movie but if you are a fan you have to watch it,1
Decent comedy for those who like crude humor. Decent.,1
I'm a big Jonny Depp fan so I had to have this movie,1
Can't go wrong with a Johnny Depp and Tim Burton movie. Not my favorite but definitely worth watching,1
"I like just about EVERY movie with Jonny Depp, and Michelle Phiefer (i beleive that's the spelling) is great to watch too!",1
"Not one of Johnny Depp's best movies, but good all around fun.",1
Funny movie. Will capture your attention. Must have for Johnny fans.,1
"I saw this for the first time, it had a few good laughs in it",1
There were some interesting parts for sure but none the less still a good choice,1
More a comedy than an extension of the original soap. Still entertaining and true to the original.,1
"""Dark Shadows"" is Tim Burton's take on the TV show of the same name and a really cool one, at that. Great cast and a cameo of Alice Cooper. Doesn't get much better.Johnny Depp continues a successful partnership with Tim Burton which began with ""Ed Wood"" back in the early 90's. Check this movie out.",1
"Funny as heck.. One of Johnny Depp""s funnier movies.",1
"Delightfully cute and funny take on the classic story of Barnabas Collins. Look for the cameos of Angelique, Josette/Maggie, and Quentin - pretty cool! Great music with this good spoof too.",1
i seen this in theater since the collaboration of burton and depp have good quality in filmmaking and it doesnt fail to be.,1
vampire & witch fighting each other then Barnabas getting his revenge,1
"As ridiculous as it is, I still love the simplicity of this movie. Just a great movie to watch and not have to think about. Johnny Depp is is usual self and I love how is personality adds to the role. This is not an award winning movie by any means! Nothing too scary, but there are quite a few risque references so it might not be appropriate for the young.",1
Johnny Depp did really well in this movie. It is different than your usual vampire movie with good comedy.,1
"Good Blu Ray transfer, very fun movie to watch, not Oscar worthy by any means",1
liked this movie.........................................,1
"Johnny Depp plays another wacky character, his speciality",1
"If you like Johnny Depp and horror movies, you are likely to enjoy this movie (though do not expect a real horror movie...this is more of a comedy).",1
"Loved the 60's TV show, movie was silly, but fun!!",1
Funny take on the original series. Be sure to catch the cameos from the original Barnabas. The soundtrack added to the movie.,1
Good movie worth watching and owning for the collection would recommend,1
Movie was ok. It may be a little too mature to watch as a family movie if you have little ones under 10.,1
I thought it was funny and interesting movie with a twist.,1
"Ladies working with johnny made this film good. Tastefully done, the original series was a gold mine of strange and swirling horror mayhem. I feel the ending suited to make you remember just how weird the show truly had become.",1
"Definitely better than I was expecting it to be, you can definitely tell this has Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter style to it.",1
"Not into these type of movies normally, but this was an exception!",1
"Some like him. Some don't. But if you like vampires, camp, and don't mind remakes too much, you might like Dark Shadows. Johnny's Barnabas Collins finds himself stranded in the present and has to find his balance, all the while fighting the witch who put him in this position. Does he find love again? Watch it and find out.",1
"I grew up on the old TV Dark Shadows so I was happy to see this come out, I was pleased that Everyone enjoyed it not just me. Some darkness, some sexy moments, and funny without being silly.",0
If your an old fan of the original series be sure and take this for what it is and enjoy it at that. It's years and years of compiled Dark Shadows compressed into a movie with it's own bend and some humor scattered into the mix. It was entertaining. The sets are incredibly rich as always with a Tim Burton film.,1
I thought that this was a nice remake of the original and I at least enjoined it. Plus I had downloaded this and had to buy it for my brother.,1
"fine, i am a fan of johnny depp. i like the price and the convenious of ordering on line",1
"A take off on the original Dark Sahdows, wasn't what I was expecting but love Johnny Depp",1
"Once again, Johnny Depp did a really good job getting the character. Pretty solid movie.",1
nostalgic movie and enjoyed very much. was worth the money spent.,1
"The film works fairly well. The funny bits are funny and the scary bits are... well, I guess they could unnerve some people. Burton's usual color scheme is in effect, so expect a lot of dark colors with red highlights. The cinematography was a pleasant surprise, as the shots tend to be very much in the style of old Hammer Horror films (Horror film buffs should keep an eye out for shots that resemble some of your old favorites). The soundtrack is a nice mix of Danny Elfman's score and 70s rock. This is used to great effect throughout the movie (most notably Nights in White Satin).The film is not Burton's best, nor is it Depp's (Both of which would be Ed Wood in my opinion). It is an entertaining film, nothing particularly special... but there's a sense of nostalgia to it... Both for fans of the show and old Burton fans.",1
Fun movie. Spouse likes it so we bought it. Decent entertainment for a night in.,1
What can I say? Any movie with Johnny Depp has GOT to be GOOD!,0
"Excellent movie if you like dark comedies. Johny Depp is excellent, as usual.",1
"Not like the show, but it wasn't too bad to watch.",1
"Having a vague remembrance of the original TV Dark Shadows, I came to this movie with low expectations and it turned out to be pretty fun. I watched it with a fan of the old TV series and she got an even bigger kick out of it than I did. Ok ... it is dumb ... but entertaining nonetheless.",1
Overall great Tim Burton movie. As always Johnny Depp and Helena Bonam Carter are great.,1
Great for your home collection expecially it you like Johnny Depp and Michelle Phifer.,0
a surpisingly good performance by the daughter in this movie.A good movie overall to watch,0
"i watched this movie in the theaters and i loved this movie from the start. this was a remake of the old version of dark shadows. the movie was set in the hippie days in a booming community dependent on the commercial fishing, the movie starts buy a crew of construction workers uncovering what has been buried for years (barbus Collins). as he restore's what once was collin wood he runs into the witch that has cursed him and from their things get very interesting as them compete against one another. i dont want to give to many details but the movie was overall great and need be watched by anyone that likes johnny depp movies.",0
"The movie was funny, acting was great, but it still can't beat the original tv series.",1
"Great acting by Johnny Depp and cast, make a great family movie",1
I wish it could have ended better to many loose ends...make a part 2,1
this was a funny movie. johnny depp is super hilarious.,1
everytime tim burton and johnny depp make a movie you can almost tell its gonna be dark. the fact that they are able to take a average soap opera and revive it 40 years later just goes to show you that you don't need a 100 million dollar budget to make a good movie. acting was great and the special effects were right up the burton avenue. all in all a good mature family comedy,1
A fish out of water movie that turns into an underdog rising up.,1
Movie not so great.Johnny Depp lots of fun to watch.,1
I bought this for my daughter. She is Johnny Depp fan. We watched it. She loved it. It was good but I think I just remember the old series so I was expecting more of that. It was good.,1
I am a Johnny Depp fan. I enjoyed Dark Shadows. The movie was entertaining and had enough drama within the story. Worth owning!,1
"This movie was listed as a comedy, but it was mostly a dry humor. Still interesting to watch though.",1
I was looking for a non-scary halloween movie & found this on sale. Its a ridiculous movie but I liked it.,1
This was a totally awesome movie. Can't wait until part 2 comes out.,1
"While not a really good movie, Johnny Depp does a good job keeping it interesting. For the price, it's a good one to pick up.",1
"Having been a long time fan of the original - this was a welcome treat to watch --- Some pretty racey 'skin' sequences - so not really ment for the youngsters -- but elsewise, a fun film to watch.",1
Good movie was better than I had heard. I wanted to see because I love the tv series.,1
"Brings me back to the TV series. Fun, well done. Johnny Depp is great.",1
I got for a cheap price.. The movie was meh okay..,1
This is a very funny movie that makes fun of the old soap opera Dark Shadows.,1
"I loved this movie, very funny. Have seen once already. I love actor Johnny Depp as Barnabus Collins, & how can u go wrong with any movie Michelle Phieffer is in!",1
"I found the movie Funny, charming and entertaining.",1
I'll play your silly game and take the points for reviewing the movie. Either you liked it or you didn't.,1
Good movie to watch with friends around Halloween time.,1
I remember the old Dark Shadows from back in the day. So different. I thought it was funny and enjoyable.,1
This isn't the best Depp/Burton movie but it is actually pretty decent. Check it out!,1
Tim Burton's take on popular daytime Horror Soap Opera. Fans of Depp and Green will enjoy.,1
Good movie for the price got it on black friday deal,1
"I love Tim Burton,The way he uses his camera angles and shots tells a story in itself. I watch movies from the editors point of view, oddly enough one of my favorite scenes is when everyone is talking at the table and you can see chloe dancing to music in the background !",0
"This is a great spoof on the ""Dark shadows"" theme. Funny",1
"""I'm not good. I'm not gentle. And I don't forgive."" This is one of my favorite movie quotes ever. Having never seen the television series Dark Shadows, except in a clip here and there, I was a clean slate. It's serious, it's funny, it's hysterical. One of those movies you're not sure if it's a dramatic comedy or a comedic drama.",1
Although I thought it would be funnier...this proves that Johnny Depp is a great versatile actor!,1
"I love the dark humor in this movie. Eva Green is a beautiful woman, and she plays the witch perfectly. If you like dark comedy movies, I recommend you to grab this movie to your collection. Great for Halloween movie night, or any night.",1
"This has to be the best movie in the whole world, it has amazing actors -Johnny Depp!!- and its hilarious. I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!",1
Daughter loves the movie. Had to buy it. She still watches it,1
"really funny movie - wanted to add it to my collection - love the cameos at the ""Dance"" and Alice Cooper steals the show ""Ugliest woman I've ever seen"" - great line !!!",1
Purchased for $3.99. I figured we couldn't go wrong at that price. Very entertaining and we'll worth the price.,1
My teenager really thinks a great movies and has told several of her friends,1
I have seen every Tim Burton movie and had to get this one to finish my collection. This movie rocks!,1
bought it off the sale rack. funny movie will watch again.,1
"Johnny Depp is a fantastic choice for the lead in this movie. I love the update this story received. Angelique is hysterical, and the dynamic between Barnabus is great. The entire cast was a great ensemble of talent.",1
"Johnny Depp returns as Barnabas Collins in this remake of the classic horror drama Dark Shadows. A very interesting take on the original, and fitting a lot of story into such a short time. I don't want to give too much away, but it is a great movie.",1
"This movie was hilarious. There were serious parts, but the comedy element definitely made this movie a classic for me!",1
Got this for my mom who watched the original series. Great buy at only $6.00!,1
"Good time movie,watch with frends or by your self!",1
It's not too scary or anything. It might creep out some of the dorkier kids though.,1
"This is a funny,interesting Tim Burton film & creative.",1
Bought this for my mom! Great film! Another great johnny depp movie!,1
"My Daughter loves this movie, I haven't seen it yet.",1
This movie has an excellent cast. It is pretty funny.,1
Many reasons to buy this 1. Tim Burton movie 2. Johnny Depp and great cast. Dark with laughs. 3. Great price,1
"I'm a purest, so no new movie will beat the original series, with that said, go ahead and watch it.",1
"A rehash of the old Dark Shadows soap opera albeit a slightly different perspective. Johnny Depp, was good, but he's been better in others. Glad to see Alice Cooper in the movie.",1
"You can really never go wrong with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. Interesting take on vampires coming into a more modern setting after a prolonged slumber.If you enjoy this try Queen of The Damned!",1
Surprisingly funny. Witty humor. Can watch it over and over again.,1
Great fun to view this in the quality of Blue Ray disc.,1
"If it has Johnny Depp in it, then it is spectacular!",1
Great movie. My husband didn't like it so I guess it's not for everyone.,1
"Great movie! Found this in a Best Buy $5.00 bin, great buy!",1
Im not too familiar with the classic show on which this is based on. However it stars a handful of my favorite actors. I like that they all have unique abilities.,1
Not the Dark Shadows I grew up with but Mr.s Burton and Depp make it their own as only they can.,1
Johnny Depp amazes me each time he makes a movie..,1
one of Johnny Depp's top 10 oddest movie roles. ...But he plays ODD well.,1
My whole family loved this dark comedy remake of the horror soap classic series.,1
Johnny Depp never fails to entertain me. Just another character he mastered!,1
Great movie my wife loves johnny depp movies. Great price,1
I loved the movie in everything Best Buy Offers and help that give me,1
This movie is one of my favorite Depp movies. The plot is a feel good but keeping it weird type of story line that holds you to the screen. Great if you want to laugh & be intrigued by all the wacky but believable characters. Loved it!!,1
"I love this twist to the 'undead' style movie. Depp is a great actor, and doesn't disappoint.",1
"Maybe not Depp's best film, but great price and still Depp.",1
"It has alot of comic relief, my wife kept going on about how good it was so we decided to get it and it was alot better then i thought it would be",1
Good take on an old show. JLM is fantastic in this film.,1
One of the best funny horror movies and the attention to detail is amazing.,1
"Important qualifier - I have never seen an episode of the Dark Shadows TV series. This is my one and only exposure to the Dark Shadows world and I'm sure it is little-to-nothing like the source material.This is your typical Burton-Depp-Bonham Carter collaboration. Dark, darkly-funny, and darkly-weird. Though this collaboration also gets the amazing benefit of Michelle Pfeiffer and Eva Green's on-screen presence.I thought it was loads of fun for pure escapist viewing.If you are looking for something that pays direct tribute to the series, it's my understanding that you will be disappointed.",1
"A love triangle between a witch, vamp and a human.",1
Never watched the show.I loved this movie. Johnny Depp was spot on as a vampire. Loved Michelle Pfeiffer as the mom and Chloe Grace as the agnsty teen. Movie looked amazing and was a joy to watch IMO.,1
A tongue and cheek version Dan Curtis beloved late 60's soap opera done in one film. Funny! A must for Dark Shadows fans!! Depp in another great role.,1
Love love love this movie. It's so good and it's even better with the blue ray bringing it to life.,1
"Being an older than most I remember watching the original TV series, but back then I did not watch every show and in the end lost interest. Now many years later this movie puts the pieces together with a twist of humor that JD brings to the screen. The movie has some over the top moments that may makes it a bit much much for kids under 13, but otherwise OK.",1
Played a very interesting vampire than others I've seen,1
I love Johnny Depp movies I have several of them glad to add to my collection,1
"another top tim burton/johnny depp movie, those two will never disappoint me when it comes to their movies",1
"Really fun movie to watch. I love the lead character, great actor. Glad I bought it.",1
"When I first heard that Burton was doing Dark Shadows I was a bit worried. After all, how could it compete with the original Quite well, as it turns out. True, the original concept would have made 'purists' happy, but Depp, while acknowledging ALL the built-in comedy, intentionally (I hope) down-plays the humor, making it work even better. Michelle Pfeiffer was WONDERFUL as Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard! Forceful and pragmatic. And beautiful, of course! Helena Bonham-Carter (My FAVORITE Ophelia!) was FANTASTIC as Dr Julia... even down to some of the mannerisms used in the TV show... I must admit that I thought the 'adjustment to the pedigree' was added a bit too late, but after watching it more-than-once (which is EASY to do) it bothers me less each time I watch it. I must acknowledge the cameo of the original Barnabas, Johnathan Frid, at the 'happening'. NICE touch! I originally saw it in the theater and vowed that I would own it when it came out on DVD. Preordered. DONE! I cannot think of ANYTHING I truly disliked about this movie... Nothing at all!",0
"I loved this movie, went to see it in theaters because it was the only one my friends and I could agree on. I wasn't sure what to expect but it didn't disappoint but its not a movie to let kids under 16 to watch. I was surprised with some of the scenes and because of them the rating.",0
"i used to watch it long ago when i was a lot younger, it was scary, now, it's just too funny. actually, you can't appreciate it unless you watched it in the 60s. and i am watching the 60's series on NETFLIX, so i love it even more...",0
Everyone in my house enjoyed this movie. glad i bought it. Wish i seen it at the theatre,0
"I LOVED THIS MOVIE, EVEN THOUGH IT IS ABOUT A VAMPIRE, IT IS MORE OF A COMEDY THAN WHAT THE ORIGINAL DARK SHADOWS WAS, BUT LOVED IT JUST THE SAME.........I WATCH THE ORIGINAL DS MOVIES WHEN I CAN, BUT NOW WILL THROUGH IN JOHNNY'S VERSION ALSO!!!!!!",1
bought the movie cause I love Johnny Depp! Its entertaining!,1
"I used to watch the old Dark Shadows soap opera while I was growing up. I always liked the show so when I saw that Dark Shadows had come out on disc, I had to buy it. Brought back so many memories. Johnny Depp was really good in this movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who liked the series.",1
It's insanely funny from the beginning to the end.,1
I was not sure I would like this movie because I didn't like the TV show. This is a fun movie with no slow parts.,1
Johnny Depp always plays interesting characters and this Movie is no different,1
"Find two hours, put on the big screen with the surround sound and enjoy this. Serious enough to be real Dark Shadows, but with just enough fun to make it successful as a movie adaptation of a 42 year old television series.",1
"Glad I bought it also bought for my sister, she also loved it",1
dark comedy. Johnny Depp plays his part well as Barnibus,1
Great family movie.... Price was amazing... Cheap in price...,1
"I thought Dark Shadows was great. The blatant, eerie humor was perfect. Even so, some of the characters' stories were a bit strange and didn't make sense, but this happens a lot when a long story is squished into a short movie. Also, from what I have heard, the soap opera which this is based on, was serious, whereas the movie is a big laugh.",1
its a great movie with good special effects. Johnny Depp did a great job,1
Entertaining edgy love story. You don't have to be a Depp or old Dark Shadows fan to enjoy it!,1
"Great movie. It was much better than I expected. Very entertaining and Johnny Depp is back again doing what he does best, being funny and weird. You will absolutely love this movie!",1
Bought this for my sister who is a BIG Dark Shadows fan from the 70's television show. She loves it and that makes me happy.,1
This movie is very funny. I have watched it over and over again since buying it.,1
Really good movie. It preserved the spirit of the original but also gave it some humor without becoming stupid.,1
"Johnny Depp as Barnabas Jones, reawakened & having to cope with ""life"" in modern times while battling with the witch whoturned him into a vampire, is a hoot! Johnny has a gift for portraying somewhat skewed characters.",1
Based on a flash-in-the-pan television show but the recreation with fantastic actors and accurate portrayal of the time period is great!,1
"For starters I am a Johnny Deep fan, and as always he has a unique way of portraying characters, he does it amazingly on any genre, I don't like vampire movies, but this one is really amazing, the blu-ray ultra violet combo makes it better",1
One of the most horrifying and disturbing movies ever made. This is not for the faint of heart. Recommend watching it during the day.,1
"tongue in check satire with the original movie. we liked it, although it is a reach.....",0
"Mr. Depp does a great job of being an eccentric vampire.All in all, very funny.",0
"This movie was great. It has a good story line, plot well done and ending was good also. Of course just about any movie that Johnny Depp is in is usually good and well written. Insanely funny in many parts, but using words that your children won't know so if they are young they miss the joke which is great. Because they are adult jokes anyways. In my opinion a must see.",1
"Everything about this movie is great. The comedy, characters, acting, sets, costumes, everything. Johnny Depp once again delivers an amazing character leading an amazing cast and the whole look of the film is perfect. My favorite part is when Alice Cooper plays a concert at the family's mansion.",1
I found the album to be enjoyable any fan of music should check it out,1
This movies is very funny and has some great music in it. It will make you baby boomers feel nostalgic,1
"I will watch this over and over again, love Johnny Depp",1
"This movie was very, very enjoyable! Johnny Depp is deliciously over the top in his role and it really works.",1
Great family movie. Johnny Depp is hysterical. Fun for all ages.,1
I really like this movie and I got it at a great price!,1
Johnny Depp is always a good actor in any movie he plays in this is a really good movie.,1
Haven't see such a nice movies for a while. Recommend to everyone.,1
This movie is hilarious. Tim burton did a fantastic job. great cast,1
"If you enjoy his movies, you know that no two movies are alike, and you never know where the movie is going. Another enjoyable movie fron Johnny",1
"I purchased the movie at my daughter's behest, she being a fan of Tim Burton's works and not to mention Johnny Depp. I was accustomed to the daytime running series sometime ago, and I remembered how the family was ""glued"" to the television set, waiting to see what would happen during the next episode. The movie was in a word, GREAT! The one-liners, the 1970's setting, the action, all of it...a treat for me!",1
I have watched it ten times. I enjoy it and it makes i laugh.,1
Awesome reboot to the old tv show. Not at all overly corny like the commercials show.Another great film by johnny depp.,1
Great movie and funny comedy. Thought it was hilarious.,1
Johny Depp is my all time favorite actor! And this movie is hilarious! I reccomend it,1
Bold humor in this movie is awesome. Plus some bloody action is always cool.,1
My daughters and I love this movie. The comedy and story is great.,1
Johnny Depp is such an amazing actor. He definitely knows how to get into any character he portrays!,1
Just what i wanted. Love this movie. Johnny Depp is in it can't go wrong,1
"I've always loved Johnny Depp, a truly great actor. I grew up watching the original Dark Shadows, and Tim Burton's flick is fun and unique, Johnny Depp creating a version of Barnabas that is lovable and hysterically funny at the same time. One of the most wonderful things about this movie, is that they didn't try to just copy the original. When they tried that short lived remake with Ben Cross, all they did was make a long, drawn out rip off of the original movie, House of Dark Shadows. I love this movie.",1
This is an amazing movie that I love to watch with my sister's kids!,1
"Great fun, very funny an overall good experience .",1
I have always loved Johnny Dep! =) Kinda gory but good story if you like vampires and stuff.,1
"Loved all the characters and the actors who played them. Well done for the movie version of the tv series! Loved the series, both the original and the remake too.",1
"Awesome purchase! This movie is amazing, and very entertaining!!",1
"Love the throwbacks to the original TV series I watched as a teenager - also the cameos of the original cast at the ""dance"" - ALICE COOPER stole the show - but Johnny Depp is excellent as always !!!",1
Very good price for a DVD and hS a very clear picture even though Blu Ray is still better but this was a gift for a dear friend since he doesn't own a blu ray player yet but this is a very good movie.,1
"In my younger years I watched the soap series of Dark Shadows and loved the show. Since Johnny Depp is my all time favorite sctor, I had to have the movie. Great movie!",1
"Perfect SD Card, on sale and an excellent price! get one!",1
"As a fan of Dark Shadows it""s great to have this in my collection, very happy.",1
I loved this old series - saw the remake. it was so funny,1
This.mocie artsnslow butngive ir a.chance I found it being somewhat finny and sarcastic... I very much like all the actors so enjoyed the.movie,1
"Great movie, not like the original serries, but a wonderful tim Burton twist",1
"Loved the movie when it first came out. Could not beat the price at checkout, so had to get it.",1
Great Movie. I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and love everything he is in.,1
"The movie is very fun!I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp and this movie again satisfied my expectation! If you like other movies featuring Johnny Depp, then you must check this out, too.",1
I like this movie. I like vampires. I like jonney depp.,1
"Loved this movie! Funny, stupid and gross all in one.",1
"I love Johnny Depp, and Tim Burton. How can you go wrong?",1
"This has to be the best movie in the whole world, it has amazing actors -Johnny Depp!!- and its hilarious. I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!",1
"This is a real guilty pleasure.An inept, stagy,artificial production with a condescending take on youth culture. Made in the waning years of Eivis's popularity by studio hacks, it is a real mess. For a movie about water sports, skiing,speed boat racing,the only water is rear screen projected or thrown in Presley's face when he's pretending to ski or pilot a boat. Now this may appear like I'm slagging the movie, and I am, but in a good way. This is a movie that is so bad that it is a work of art. I was hoping how stupid am I that the repackaging would come with a better transfer of the movie, but alas no, it is the same horrible non enhanced version. So this is a big, big disappointment. hopefully someday Clambake will be released with a better transfer or on Blu ray so true fanslike me can really wallow in it's tacky, cheesy, awfulness.",1
"While Clambake was certainly not at the top of the heap of Elvis fun-in-the-sun movies, the least they could have done was do a competent job with the mastering of this disk. The quality, while not the worst I've seen, is below average and there are flaws galore, most noticeably at about 48:40 where the picture is so wavy that appears like it was shot underwater until a thick white line washes across the screen from botton to top and resolves the image. Does no one even view these things before the discs are pressed and sold What a rip-off!!",1
"I've enjoyed some of Elvis' movies like Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, and Fun in Acapulco. I received Clambake as a gift to add to my collection, and I thought I'd like it especially because it took place in Miami, where I'm from.Sadly, this was not a very good movie. The late-60s styles were comical, and the young days of Christine from Coach and Bill Bixby from The Hulk were amusing. However, the obvious closed sets, corny acting and oddball music interludes kept me asking why was this movie even produced.The final insult to injury... Elvis and his girl drive into the Florida sunset... with mountains in the background! The only mountains in Miami are trash dumps so this was obviously shot in California and poorly passed off as Miami Beach.So I give it 2 stars: one for Elvis and one for the real Florida.",1
"Not one of Elvis's best movies, but it has some good songs in it and parts of the storyline are not too bad. I felt this DVD was not compressed too well, the picture is fuzzy in parts and there are original old-Reel markings in some scenes. The sound is OK but overall it should have been much better quality considering DVD is suppose to be better than VHS.- I would wait for a second release. Thanks.",1
"There are basically four criteria by which I judge an Elvis movie: the songs and how they relate to the movie's story Elvis' acting performance Elvis' co-stars' performance and the story itself.The songs used in Clambake (especially the title song itself) are not well-written. In fact, they are so forgettable that I can't recall any of them as stand-outs. The best one is probably the one (title) he sings on the beach. The song he co-sings while riding a motorbike in the movie is relatable to the story and it does look like Elvis is into the song. However, I think that speaks more to Elvis' charm as a musical performer. Although if you have ever seen Harum Scarum (and if you have not... I do NOT recommend you do), you will see Elvis at his most UNenthusiastic when it comes to singing the movie's songs. The song he sings to/with the children at the park playground is way too long and seemingly filler material... having little of anything to do with the story.As for Elvis' acting performance, I've seen him give worse performances (Harum Scarum definitely tops the list of other Elvis movies I have seen), but I have also seen better (Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, Viva Las Vegas, to name just three). He definitely held his own in this movie. I'll leave it at that. I don't recall any fight scenes in this movie, which I find/found a refreshing change (it's been a few days since I watched it and have watched other Elvis movies since then).Shelley Fabares (if you remember her from the 80s/90s TV show Coach) was likable as the leading lady in this film. Bill Bixby (later most familiar as David Banner from The Incredible Hulk) played the protagonist well because I didn't like him... which was intentional. Will Hutchins (maybe known from his earlier role in another Elvis movie, Spinout) plays Tom Wilson, the waterski instructor whose identity Elvis' character (Scott Heyward) assumes in the movie... is adequate.As for the story itself, it has (for me) two elements I have enjoyed in my own life (motorcycle riding and waterskiing), so I'm probably being more generous about this movie's appeal then I would be otherwise... but that is why all opinions are biased.Instead of outlining the plot, I will just summarize that visually, this movie is more attractive to the eye than many of Elvis' other movies (that have too many studio sets instead of using outdoor shots). Although most of this film was shot in California than Florida, they pulled it off.Elvis' movies, for the most part were make you feel good movies, so to judge this as anything more than that would be doing Elvis a disservice. This film did mark the beginning of the end for Elvis in a number of ways. It was the last film for which he received a guaranteed million dollar salary. He also began overeating prior to this movie and had to take diet pills to reverse the direction his weight was heading. No more needs to be said.If you are like me and either have only a few Elvis movie DVDs in your collection (I have about 10 of his 31) and are wondering which ones are more enjoyable than others, I can only give you a general guideline and that is that most of his better movies were from the FIRST third of the 31. I don't think you can go wrong at all by picking any of his first five (Love Me Tender, Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, King Creole, and GI Blues) as well as Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, It Happened At The World's Fair, Roustabout, and Follow That Dream. I think these movies do a better job of showcasing Elvis' untapped acting potential. I wrote untapped because you could see if he was given better scripts (especially after his first five movies), he could have shown so much more of what he had to offer. Thanks a lot Hal Wallis!Overall, I don't recommend this movie for purchase unless you have to have every movie in which Elvis has appeared.",1
"Being a low price DVD, you do not really expect much, unfortunately though this really goes too far resulting in the VHS version being far better quality. I expect the powers that be thought this film is only aimed at hardcore Elvis fans and corners were cut, this would be the same thought process that managed to produce these calibre of films to start with. I am also surprised that some of the other films in MGM's vaults were not released first, examples being It Happened At The Worlds Fair and Live A little Love A little, especially with the worldwide success of A Little Less Conversation.",1
"...and I thought the quality was on the poor side for DVD format...it DOES feature ELVIS in about every scene...and if you are a die-hard ELVIS FAN like myself - you have the honor of simply watching this beautiful man, and in some pretty snazzy duds for the time I might add, through the duration of the movie.Most of all, if you don't get it for any other reason, this is the only opportunity to experience the unforgetable, breath-taking scene of ELVIS singing The Girl I Never Loved - a truly beautiful love song (1 of his best,IMO)amidst a paradise at sunset background. (sigh...sniff...) I have looked elsewhere, trying to find this song to no avail.",1
"Clambake starring Elvis Presley,Shelley Fabares,Will Hutchins,Bill Bixby,Gary Merrill,and James Gregory was an entertaining film with a very good cast.It's a take-off on the Prince and the Pauper story of a rich man that swaps identity with a poor man and wants to see if he can be a success without the family wealth.Too bad the quality of the print used in making this DVD was poor.The sharpness is disappointing, the color is weak, and there are numerous artifacts seen such as scratches and streaks.Also,the soundtrack is mediocre at best,even though a true HiFi/stereo soundtrack was originally recorded by Elvis for this release.There is no excuse for this hatchet-job,and I recommend you avoid purchasing this title until a respectable effort is made to produce a high-quality copy of this film.If you are a die-hard Elvis fan you'll probably buy it for your library,but the studio did justice to no one with the release of this DVD.Shame on the greedy leeches!",1
"Like every 1966-67 Elvis movie, you have pretty girls in slight outfits, EP loves a girl that another wants (and usually has for a while anyway), EP has to fight someone, EP sings with children, EP has to win something (ie: auto race, boat race, high diving, etc., EP sings really dumb songs but usually has at least one really good one (You Don't Know Me and The Girl I Never Loved), lots of Memphis Mafia in the background (Red West, Ice Cream Man, Charlie Hodge the Barber, Joe and Richard in bit parts at the Clambake - note no clams shown) and EP gets the girl. Las Vegas, Hawaii, Mexico, Florida, anywhere they are all the same and that includes spending 2 hours just looking at this wonderfully handsome man. If you love just seeing him this one is for you.",1
"Great DVD, one of his best. Thank you for having it.",1
Another Great Elvis movie.,1
"I have seen every one of Elvis's movies over and over again. This is my very favorite one. Even people I know who don't care for his movies liked this one. Elvis plays a rich guy who changes places with a poor guy. He wants to get a girl who likes him for himself and not for his money. The songs in this movie are his best. Bill Bixby plays the guy you love to hate. Everyone does a great job making this a really fun movie. If you are ever going to buy any of Elvis's movies, this is the one to buy.",1
I expected more from this movie and more from zac Enron. I would give this movie a D. Try neighbors 2 instead,1
"Would ABSOLUTELY NOT recommend. We could only take 15 minutes of it and had to stop. Definitely a movie for our son in college. If I could return, I would.",1
Terrible movie with good actors. Can't believe I spent 20 bucks on it. The trailer is as funny as it's gonna get.,1
This movie is terrible with only a few funny scenes.,1
This was a boring movie i couldnt watch 20 minutes,1
"I found this movie boring, stupid and a waste of time and money. Not funny at all.",1
You'll enjoy this if your 18. It was rather boring and gross for my tastes.,1
"Instead of buying this movie, just burn your money, it is easier and less time consuming!",1
"The trailers made the movie look like it had potential to be a funny movie...it did have its moments, but that was it, the rest of the movie was not good....not one I would recommend!",1
At times hard to watch.Characters morons.Acting not much better,1
Some of the comedy was extreme to the point of not being funny. The female actors looked sickly.,1
"Typical Zac Efron comedy, Anna Kendrick always good. Wedding dates in Hawii",1
"A good fraternity movie without plot, character, and reason but tried to shock.",1
It looked funny and has its moments but maybe I expected more from the movie but didn't deliver on full humor but raunchy humor.,1
Thought this movie could be funnier. The previews always show the best parts. And I thought the movie is a let down. They try too hard to be funny........,1
"This movie was cheesy. If you saw the commercial, you've seen the funniest part of the movie.",1
i like stupid comedy's so it was ok . see it once .,1
Sorry Zac but you need to take acting classes if you want to survive in Hollywood. Looks fade,1
I heard this movie was amazing i watched it and it sucked,1
Not really as funny as previews make it out to be.,1
there were a few laughs but the story is weak and the language it over the top. Not appropriate for under 17.,1
I had higher hope for this movie and was disappointed with the story and the jokes. Rent this don't buy it,1
I was really excited when i bought this movie however was disappointed.,1
"Movie is ok... Not really good and not really bad.... It lost my attention and a day after I watched it, I can not remember 1 scene from it",1
Raunchy comedy. Much of it not all that humorous unless you're a millennial that sees low value cheap shot political correctness as funny.,1
"not really worth a purchase, maybe not even a rental",1
A few funny parts but overall not a movie I'd watch multiple times. It's a renter.,1
"Couple of laughs, but typical comedy. Felt a lot like a Wedding Crashers knock off.",1
What to say about this movie. There were some very funny parts. There are some very explicit parts as well. Not likely to watch again. You may want to rent this.,1
Not outstanding but not bad either. No sequel based on box office.,1
"It borders on the mediocrity. Still, for low brow comedy... one can do worse.",1
This was a decent movie... Other than hearing a few lines that were clearly ripped off from other comedians and movies.,1
"So so movie has its good spots, but overall entertaining",1
Received movie quick and in great condition. Loaded the digital copy in my library very easy. Watched it. It has its moments. Adam Devine is hilarious. He was my favorite in the movie. Overall I give it a 6.5 out of 10,1
The movie was OK I thought it was gonna be much more entertaining.,1
Overall this movie is very average. With that being said it is worth seeing for the 2-4 times you will be laughing out loud.,1
"It's not especially a good movie, but it is kinda funny.",1
Not a good movie but entertaining.Abrey Plaza is pretty good here though not my favorite actress.,1
Great date night movie.. Must watch it with your mother so she gets embarrassed.,1
"Had potential to be a great comedy, but missed on a few lines. Still a decent comedy in a year when most comedies seemed lack luster. Beware if bawdy humor is not your thing. Stay away!!!",1
A little silly at times - but funny and even adorable (a few times). Mostly a comedy that allows you to sit in the theater and think :: I know someone just like that::,1
This type of humor is off the chart crazy. When the women are the bad ones.,1
Not a new concept but funny and warm hearted at the end,1
"I was expecting more. I have enjoyed movies from 3 of the 4 main characters, but I just thought it could have been so much funnier.",1
This movie had its moments. It also had a lot of misses. I gave 3 stars because tasteless humor is right in my line.,1
"Not the best movie in the world, but far from the worst.",1
Thought it would be funnier with the previews enjoyed the movie but very predictable,1
Semi funny movie. Could of been a lot better but to late now.,1
"I could have lived without seeing this movie. It was amusing, but not a keeper for me.",1
"One might call Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates director Jake Szymanski's feature debut and to a degree I guess that's correct as this is his first film getting a wide theatrical release (and his first that runs over an hour), but Szymanski is no stranger to comedy or the space in which it occupies in Hollywood. In fact, Szymanski turned Andy Samberg's rather thin idea for a 30 for 30 parody into a rather entertaining forty-five minutes last summer. All of this doesn't necessarily mean that Mike and Dave is anything more than one might expect it to be (it's not) and despite sounding like one of those straight to VHS American Pie knock-offs where you might find Tara Reid and the chubby kid from The Sandlot working not-so hard to earn a paycheck, Mike and Dave actually delivers on the promises and premise that have been set up in its marketing. Though it might seem obvious that 20th Century Fox would like to make something of a comedic brand out of Mike and Dave (Mike & Dave Go to London, Mike and Dave Take the World) it somewhat feels as if Szymanski and writers Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien feel the opposite. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is very much a contained story that gives our main cast of characters defined arcs that take them from one clear point in their lives to the next. What is nice about what both the writers and Szymanski do though is that they don't allow this transformative period to completely define these characters. The titular siblings are still very much who they were in the beginning of the movie at the end of the movie save for the fact they've learned a few lessons and earned some perspective. What I'm saying is that Mike and Dave doesn't turn into a fable of some kind where the intent of the film is to teach its characters and audience a lesson, but rather is more about the challenges and obstacles presented in a certain situation and how a specific type of person deals in the messes they've made. This is undoubtedly the films strongest trait in that it doesn't become wholly what we expect though it is mostly the obtrusive and familiar raunchy comedy you hoped it would be if you bought a ticket in the first place. That said, Mike and Dave delivers some modest pleasures for, despite largely adhering to the beats of the genre, it excels in hitting those beats through a likable and appealing cast.",0
The Movie Was Alright And The Acting Was Ok Too. B-},1
It was a funny movie but some of the jokes weren't.,1
Although the movie is funny. It's nothing new that hasn't been done in previous comedies.,1
good movie about golddigging women taking advantage of two naive guys who forgot to grow up.,1
My review isn't that fair because i love anything with anna kendrick. I want to marry her.,1
This movie is more of a rental than a buy. It was fun to watch one time but I will probably never watch again.,1
"I was expecting it to be funnier, Not a great movie.",1
Thought it would be funnier that it was in my opinoin,1
Not as funny as I expected it to be. Wish I would of rented it rather then buy it. Not one that I would personally rewatch,1
"If you're in the mood for cheap jokes that is Zac Efron and Adam Devine then this is the movie for you. It's pretty hilarious overall and Anna kendrick is her usual cute, squirrel self. Certain parts of the movie seem to drag but enjoyable.",1
Not a great movie not a 4K experience. Had some funny moments. But I hate character flips. Not worth the buy. Certain movies come off screaming 4K Dolby Atmos experience. This is not one of them.,1
i thought this would be funnier..it was just alright.,1
Has its moments where its funny. A predictable ending though.,1
The situations that these guys appear in remind me of a Saturday Night Live skit or The Three Stooges but raunchy.,1
This wasn't as funny as I was hoping it would be.It was just ok.,1
Funny comedy pretty good on some parts of the movie very interesting,1
"It was a fun, above average comedy with a few dark twists. Not great for the whole family but definitely the adults",1
Good movie. If you want a good laugh this will work.,1
Fun watching movie. The humor is a little on the raunchy side but still funny as he**,1
If you like stupid funny films you will enjoy this.,1
Good movie not what I was hoping it would of been more funny. I still enjoyed it.Overall good movie,1
Not for the mature adults. Good teenage movie for the ages,1
"Movie was pretty funny, the actors played well with each other and there were some pretty funny scenes! Probably not a movie you will watch over and over, but worth watching at least once!",1
Not bad movie for a typical ha ha movie. I liked actors and the storyline was funny.,1
"It's a funny movie, just not as funny as I expected.",1
"Overall it is an okay movie. Nothing really stands out in it, some funny parts.",1
"I had high hopes for this movie based on the actors involved, but it wasn't nearly as funny as I hoped it would be. It's still worth a watch, but maybe my expectations were too high.",1
Not the funniest movie ive ever seen but def not the worst either..,1
Big fan of Plaza and Kendrick. Efron is good but not much in this movie compared to his co-stars. Adam Devine is just too much and really ruins plenty of funny scenes. Just rent it.,1
This movie was ok watched because on Kendrick and plaza. I got a few chuckles,1
Funny moments here and there with a mature level about it.,1
Movie was pretty funny. I feel it is worth a watch but not a purchase. More of a one and done movie.,1
"I like the characters in this movie, but it is just ok",1
We really enjoyed this movie. The brothers place an ad to get dates for a wedding. Make sure you watch the trailers.,1
Was a so so comedy for me. Could have been funnier.,1
This is an ok movie if you like Zac Efron movies.its some what funny!!,1
"Picked this up because it was on sale, and I love Turtle Bay. I love Workaholics so I'm a fan of Adam Devine's style of humor, and though this is no Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I found it funny enough for the price, and it has some nice shots of Hawaii.",1
"I like everyone in the cast. They all naturally have good chemistry. While the cast is game, the writing is not always game winning! There are no truly big laughs. There are some pretty funny moments. There are enough moments for this likable cast to grab a hold on and squeeze out a workable comedy.",1
It had its funny moments but I think that I would have rather rented it instead of bought it,1
Not a quality movie but it's still got its funny moments.,1
"It's a movie to watch when you're in a specific mood. By no means a blockbuster, but good for a few laughs with friends.",1
I don't hate it or love it but it's a movie and I wasn't disappointed.,1
Great collectors item. Goes great with the other collections,1
This is mildly funny but if you are easily offended by bad language it is not for you.,1
It was an OK movie. It had its moments. Happy I got it on sale.,1
"Will give you some good laughs, but would be better to just rent rather than to buy.",1
Haven't watched it yet but looking forward to doing so!!,1
I saw previews on tv and wanted to go to the theater to see it and missed so I bought for my stepdad as a present. It was ok.,1
"Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, and Adam Divine are all brilliant comedic talents, and Zac Efron has proven himself time and again to be an extremely talented comedic actor. Both duos have wonderful chemistry with each other, and other cast members (Sam Richardson in particular) keep up with the pace.",1
"This movie was funny, but a lot of the funny parts were shown in the trailer. There are still hilarious moments but not as much as I expected. It does end will, which makes for an overall good movie.",1
I have not had the chance to watch the movie yet but heard it was very funny and I am a sucker for a good comedy!!,1
Very R rated movie but had me laughing out loud. done in pretty good taste.,1
Pretty good comedy. Plenty of laughs all the way through the movie!,1
"Ok for adult audience, another movie in the genre of comedies and trying to have intercourse",1
I thought this would be a better movies got a few laughs out of me,1
Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. Two hard-partying brothers place an online ad to find the perfect dates for their sister's Hawaiian wedding.,1
A very funny movie but not the greatest plot. Good acting though,1
"This movie wasn't what I expected. It was a little funny but not hilarious like I thought it would be. The trailer revealed all the funny parts so when the movie was on, it wasn't that funny anymore. Too bad those were the only funny parts.",1
This is a good movie to watch if you do not want to think and just need a good laugh. I found myself laughing out loud a few times while watching this. Just what I needed after a stressful day at work.,1
"The preview looked like it could be quite funny, but in the end I thought it was just average. I would say B- on the movie itself. Picture and sound projected on my oled and marantz receiver was excellent though!",1
"One of those stupid with no substance movies, but had some decent laughs during the movie.",1
The previews were better than the actual movie. The language was foul and the comedy was juvenile.,1
Funny and different. Loved that it was themed in Hawaii,1
"I had fun watching this movie, I liked the chemistry of all the actors. A nice 4K presentation and fun features!",1
"feeling like this movie has been done before, though. But, if you simply like looking at Zac Efron, and you don't want to think too hard, this is your kind of movie!",1
Was not too impressed with the movie I only bought it cuz it was on sale didn't really like it,1
Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick are perfect as best friends who maneuver themselves into a destination wedding/vacation. And then hijinks ensue.,1
the family wanted this movieI thought is was an average movie,1
A cheesy comedy that will surprise you with some of the things that happen,1
"This is one of those movies that plays better in movie trailers than in its entirety.Mildly funny in a few scenes and worth a viewing on a lazy day at home,but nothing about this movie stands out in a field of similiar,goofy comedies.",1
"I think the summary says it all. It was cute, Andy from Modern Family is in it, don't know the other guy.",1
Thought this would be a stinker but it's not too bad!,1
"Was pretty good, however in my opinion someone else should have been casted as Erfon's brother for this movie. Efron was flawless as usual.",1
Was good for value price I paid if you like comedy,1
A great Rom com to cuddle up with whomever. Had a few good laughs but seemed to be all repeats. For a night with the significant other a great movie to watch together.,1
"The movie was ok, not what I was expecting. I would recommend it to be watched.",1
A good movie especially if you are looking for a good comedy to watch,1
funny movie diffently recommend alsome romantic comedy,1
Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates [Blu-ray/DVD] [2016] - good family movie.,1
"Great combination with the two lead actors, good movie to watch with friends",1
Was absolutely surprised by this movie. All the characters are excellent.,1
This movie is historical.yes it's a silly slapstick comedy. Be prepared to laugh throughout the entire movie.,1
Good movie. Funny,1
Really funny and entertaining to watch non stop laughing,1
Mike and Dave have a lot of fun. They place themselves on the internet needing a date for a wedding in Hawaii. Then ENJOY the movie.,1
"Funny, Funny, Funny! A guys movie for sure! not a date movie!!",1
Saw this movie in the theatre and had to get the DVD. Laughed all the way through.,1
Adam and Aubrey are funny as always... worth the purchase,1
"The movie was prett funny, the story line was okay, not the best but wasn't the worst.",1
"Extremely funny movie, dragged on a tad towards the end but overall a good comedy",1
this is a good time for all those old enough to understand,1
"Not a necessary buy, but it's a decent comedy with a decent-looking 4K release.",1
This is a good funny movie; not ideal for children. Includes a lot of dirty humor.,1
"It seems like majority of the movie is forcing the funny onto you, there are great parts but fast from being a comedy classic.",1
Nothing super revolutionary about this film but it has its moments. If you're looking for a few good laughs this might fit the bill.,1
"Don't worry about plot or character development - just sit back, relax and be ready to laugh a lot!!",1
Picture and sound are really good. The movie is funny in certain scenes.,1
"This movie is pretty funny, not as funny as I expected. But it was a good laugh!",1
"""Nice"" guys meet not so nice girls. The movie was funny but the ladies were in charge.",1
"I'm a big fan of ZAC EFFRONS work, so I buy all his films. This is a light and fun movie, the story is interesting and I had a good time. Dont expect Oscar material, but if you want to smile and titalated - this is for you! ZAC is hot and spends a lot of time shirtless - that's good enough for me!",1
A nice movie with lots of laughs but definitely not for children.,1
This movie has its ups and downs some really funny parts ands some why did they leave that part in moments,1
"This movie is great, big fan of the cast. Not for kids.",1
"Enjoyed watching this movie, very entertaining for young adults",1
It was a funny movie. Don't come in thinking it's a oscar winner. It's a fun movie and you will get some good laughs. Not so safe to watch with kids.,1
Non stop laughter from start to finish. These two guys pair up perfectly to have you rolling with laughs.,1
I enjoyed watching this funny and somewhat true story. I think that the casting was done well and thought that it was funny!,1
"The cast helps elevate the material here. Some jokes don't work as well as others, but it's a lot of fun. The story grows more familiar by the end, but that's ok. I'd recommend it.",1
This was a very good and a very funny movie with good acting.,1
A typical funny movie for Zac Effron. It's worth seeing.,1
Funny movie nice to sit with friends and laugh at the stupidity of characters.,1
Funny movie. Not for children or those easily offended by dirty jokes. Typical of the raunchy movies Zac Efron has made lately!,1
"Real funny movie..rated R kids should not see this,adult funny comedy",1
funny movie from beginning to end. good laughs and no need to think.,1
"Efron is killing it in the comedy movies lately he is funny. Story was based on true events, these guys were funny.",1
2 brothers need wedding dates and seek potential dates online... What's the worst that can happen?,1
This movie is funny from beginning to the end haha,1
"This is so funny, if you haven't seen it, go watch it.",1
My husband loves movies. Just bought this to add to them.,1
Could have been funnier but all in all alright good buy,1
"Funny, Zack enfran is great, hope they make a segual, those girls were halarious",1
this was a funny movie and i laughed hard it was a wedding smile,1
"from this point of view, you'll need to triple check your date interviews!",1
good teenage movie---lots of stupid stuff going on,1
Funny but not as in a theater I would still buy it though,1
Thought it was hilarious for the most part but had its serious parts also and I like Efron as an actor in all his movies,1
"This movie is almost exactly what you would expect from the Seth Rogen era of comedy, drug jokes, dirty jokes, awkward moment humor. Although the movie is very funny if you are into that kind of humor. If you like the cast and just want to have a night of laughs, for sure check this movie out. You will have a good time.",1
"Great premises and a great cast, however it just did not entertain me on the level that say Neighbors did.",1
But it is an entertaining movie. Not really for young teens as there are a lot of adult references.,1
"They make so many movie, and often times there just okay. the writer here must been new, cause it was fressh and funny. real fun.",1
I thought this was pretty good for a comedy. Some parts were over the top and it did have some pretty gross humor.,1
"Non stop laughs, raunchy and irreverent, a real treat",1
Full of new types of jokes and stupidity. Boys will be boys girls will be girls.,1
The whole cast is funny and keeps the viewers laughing.,1
"Two hard-partying brothers place an online ad to find the perfect dates for their sister's Hawaiian wedding. Hoping for a great getaway, instead they find themselves out hustling an uncontrollable duo. Zac was funnier in Dirty Grandpa",1
"Pretty good movie, with some pretty funny parts. I enjoyed it.",1
Wasn't expecting much from this but ended up laughing nonstop. Hard to ever look at a massage the same after this movie!,1
"I did not see the movie in the theater, I only went by word of mouth from other customers. I was taken totally by surprise with this one.",1
"Not particularly original or insightful, but very funny!!",1
This wasn't the best movie of 2016 but not the worse either. Actually pretty funny plus Aubry and Anna are good together.,1
If you are in need of a good laugh watch this movie.,1
I watched Workaholics & then when i saw that he was in this movie i knew it was going to be good.,1
It had it's moments that was funny but thats pretty much it.,1
This was a funny comedic movie with good performances through out,1
It was funny. A bit corny but still a good movie to watch if you're in the mood to laugh.,1
It's not the best movie I've seen this year but it kept me laughing and entertained throughout.,1
"I really enjoyed the movie, probably because that's my kind of humor. It was a real plus because of the locale...the place I live.",1
Great cast and laughs all around. Definitely one of the year's best comedies.,1
My daughter and her boyfriend got this and really liked it. Very funny movie!,1
There were some great laugh out loud moments. Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick were great despite some horribly cheesy dialogue at times.,1
Loved this one . Funny all the way though. Have seen it two times now.,1
It was an okay movie. I didn't laugh a lot but I chuckled occasionally There were parts that I should not have watched with my 7 yr old though,1
"Just like other comedies that aim to be raunchy, this one works out.",1
Pretty funny movie. I actually really enjoyed it from start to finish.,1
"My wife and I really enjoyed the movie, lots of laughs.",1
Good movie lots of fun .you will get lots of laughs,1
This is hilariously funny. The things that they up to in this are crazy.,1
Very entertaining movie. Would recommend to any movie lover.,1
Very funny movie. Anna Kendrick is very good in her role.,1
Not a bad movie but it was predictable. Aubrey Plaza is hilarious once again.,1
Funny movie but wouldnt let the kids watch it. Adult humor,1
Seen in the theaters and good enough to buy..get it soon,1
"This is definitely a funny movie, but I'm not sure how well the jokes will hold up under future viewings.",1
Very good movie with great blend of gross out humor and family bonding,1
Very funny movie and worth picking up. Won't be disappointed.,1
"This movie is outrageous, inappropriate, PC incorrect, raunchy stupid slapstick, so over the top that it shouldn't work but, by some miracle mixed with such enthusiastic commitment from everyone involved, this thing fires on all cylinders. It has the same OMG powerhouse energy of classics like THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Forget credibility and good taste, surrender to its shocking insanity, and you'll treat yourself to one hysterical coronary of a good time.",1
"If you like slapstick humor you will love this movie, although plot is predictable the stuff they say is rediculously funny!",1
Good movie to watch with a group of friends. Keeps you laughing,1
Good movie if you need a big laugh. Some of the scenes are way out there. Worth a look.,1
this movie is great..luv anna kendrick and zac effron...cute romantic comedy,1
One of the best comedies of 2016 that takes you on a wild adventure!,1
Good comedy...exactly what'd you'd expect with the cast,1
I purchased this as a gift and the recipient said it was a good movie and he would recommend it to his friends.,1
My wife and I had didn't have much expectations of this movie being very good. However we came out loving it. This disk has very good picture and audio quality.,1
"Great movie, very funny. I love anything with Aubrey Plaza.",1
"Though a bit more vivid than I expected, this movie provided laughter.",1
"This is the first movie in a long time that I felt was too short. While a few scenes fall flat, the actors shine.",1
You could tell just by the cast that this was going to be funny. And it did not disappoint. I would recommend this to someone having a bad day.,1
This movie is funny! A must have comedy. Aubrey Plaza steals the show.,1
A good cast and some very funny moments make it a worthy film to sit down and watch.,1
"Bought this as a gift for family movie night, the story line was a bit predictable but it was so funny that you just went with it.",1
"funny movie, not to much drama. lots of laughs. my wife and i really liked it",1
The cheesy teen movies have now turned to the cheesy 30 something movies. Not great but worth the watch and could get better the more times you watch it.,1
Very funny comedy and it's just a good time all around.,1
"Good movie, not as funny and the previews made it seem but it still has a few laughs. Worth getting if it's on sale.",1
"Whoever is in to comedy, they will enjoy watching!",1
My wife convinced me to purchase this. But it turned out to be funny,1
"Knew nothing about the movie when I got it, enjoyed it thoroughly. I figured slap stick comedy, instead it had a great story line and comic relief.",1
Pretty funny movie with an enjoyable cast that seem like they're all having fun.,1
Really funny movie I like anything that is Zac Efron is in,1
Funny movie a lot better then expected if u enjoy comedy get it,1
"Excellent movie for adults only This is particularly good in the ultra 4K high definition format. Adult humor and content, children not welcome.",1
Hilarious. Zac effron is a great comedian and the supporting cast is amazing,1
There is only so many crude jokes and nude scenes any 20 something year-old male can take. And this move exceeded both.,1
"This movie is pretty predictable, but it was fun to watch and pretty entertaining.",1
"But kind of dumb at others. Overall ok, the funny parts outweighed the dumb.",1
"This was a funny movie! I think Zach Efron is a great talent! If you like comedies, this is a no brained!",1
"This movie is hilarious, it is a must watch and you will laugh.",1
"This movie is really funny. Definitely not for kids. This is adult humor all the way. The cast is great, especially Anna Kendrick.",1
Love this movie no problems........................,1
Zach Efron and Andy Devine should be in more movies together because they are hilarious in this movie.,1
"This movie is really hilarious. If you love to just laugh and have a fun night, then this is for you.",1
not too bad. had a few laughs. zach efron and adam devine play well off of each other,1
I had low hopes for Mike and Dave but when we rented it I decided that I actually quite liked it. Very funny and silly movie. Decided that I needed to purchase it.,1
Super funny movie would recommend to my friends. A,1
Hilariously funny. Worth the money. Will watch again.,1
Silly movie but worth watching. Would recommend seeing it for a good laugh.,1
It was a really good movie. I would definitely recommend watching it.,1
"The movie was pretty funny, overall a good watch if you like raunchy comedy.",1
Great romantic comedy. Very funny. If you are looking for one a must buy.,1
"Decent comedy, dragged a bit at times. Got on Black Friday for $10 so good deal for 4k",1
"I was surprised by this. Wedding comedies are usually hit or miss. This was a hit. The actors have great charisma. The plot is predictable, but so fun to watch them get there.",1
This movie is hilarious. Nice scenes in Hawaii and lots of humor.,1
The movie was decent and had some great of humor in it. Definitely not kid friendly,1
"Overall pretty good movie, glad I purchased it at a reasonable price.",1
Not a huge amount of plot but this movie had me laughing enough to watch it twice in one weekend!,1
"Glad I didn't see it in the movies, raunchy at times, loses steam but overall funny and worth watching.",1
"This movie had a talented and hilarious young cast. The movie is based on a true story which seems too crazy to be true, but overall it was very entertaining and will be great to rewatch.",1
Any fan of outrages and over the top comedy will enjoy this underrated comedy.,1
"Good movie, but not great. I'm not sure how I feel about Zach Efron and comedy.",1
I liked the movie and the transfer was great. The movie had great sound with good extras.,1
Wedding troubles is an understatement. What could go wrong when two guys go on craigslist for dates to a wedding? Everything or almost everything. This movie is filled with drama and craziness that will keep you entertained though out.,1
I enjoyed this comedy and suggest it to anyone needing a laugh.,1
Funny movie for the most part. The girls steal the show though!,1
FUNNY MOVIE AND GREAT CONCEPT. YOU NEVER KNOW WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.,1
"This one seems like a very funny romantic type comedy. Pick it up as a new release at the good sales price. Haven't had a change to view the entire movie yet, but first glance it appears to be just a standard funny comedy. Some will like it and some will not; so far early views it is one I believe to be enjoyable",1
This was a funny movie. I will enjoy watching it again.,1
My daughter wanted this movie. She has watched it a few times already so I'd say she's enjoying it,1
Kinda over the top stupid but that's why i liked it,1
"The 4 stars are great plus a fun supporting cast! Also, Aubrey Plaza is SPICY!!!",1
Funny movie! Zac Efron and Adam Devine are hilarious as brothers!,1
"My wife and I saw this movie in the theater. Wasn't expecting much, but ended up laughing harder than I imagined. Couldn't wait for it to come out on Blu Ray. Definitely worth it!",1
Movie was great. Extremely funny! Great actors and story line!,1
This is a amusing adult comedy with a crude undertone.,1
"Very funny movie, great quality BluRay, a very good purchase",1
This was great movie with lots of action involved. The price couldnt be better when I bought during the Christmas season.,1
pretty funny movie. Definitely glad we watched this at home and not at movies. Good quality. Has some laughs. Not quite sure it will be watched again soon but definitely good for a movie night at home,1
A hilarious raucous movie that keeps you laughing.,1
I bought this movie as a gift. The recipient found it hilarious.,1
"Purchased this for my son as a stocking stuffer, him and his college buddies loved it!",1
"This movie was really funny. However, some of the scenes were definitely for mature audiences only. Lots of drug references, crude remarks, and bad language.",1
"Overall a good movie, I love main characters but it was kind of predictable for the plot of the movie.",1
Lots of good happy moments. Better then regular TV,1
If you pick up this movie make sure you are in the mood for stupid fun. The cast is very likeable and the premise very contrived. Not for young or sensitive viewers.,1
Not in danger of any awards. Just a fun silly film to watch.,1
Had a lot of funny parts for up and coming actors.,1
Another Best Buy Deal. I would give the movie a 7 out of 10. Funny moments with a happy ending.,1
"As this movie was at a decent price, I decided ""why not"". Didn't see it in movie theaters or anything like that. It was a pleasant surprise.",1
My family really loved this film. It was much funnier than the previews sounded like it would be.,1
Funny entertaining a good movie if your of the right age.,1
Overall a pretty funny movie. Zack Efron didn't play a big part.,1
Overall was better than expected and a plus that the bloopers are pretty good too!,1
This movie definitely has some good jokes. I laughed more than not for sure.,1
"A solid comedy that will make you laugh. Maybe not out loud, but it will.",1
This movie was hilarious. Wasn't sure at first if it was going to be good but I wasn't disappointed,1
This is a very good and funny movie. Some parts were just plain hilarious.,1
More my husbands movie but worth watching and adding to our comedy collection for sure,1
I'm sure this is not the movie for everyone. However I think the cast works well together and created a funny and memorable movie.,1
"The title pretty much explains the movie. Two brothers who have a rather bad habit of ruining big family events like weddings and birthdays are in the doghouse with their parents. While their sister wants them to come to her wedding, she doesn't want them coming alone to try and hit on her bridesmaids. If they can't come with dates, they aren't allowed to come at all. Since they do love their little sister, the overgrown children come up with a plan to find dates that their family would approve of. Unfortunately for them, 2 girls that are as bad as they are learn of the trip and pretend to be the women that would be the perfect fit. From there on, the movie goes through the various adventures of the characters often ending poorly, even while the two dates do their best to avoid being discovered for who they are.It is funny, but some of the humor will be considered in poor taste and there is some nudity so not for the kids. Good for some laughs (and a few groans too).",1
Movie came as expected and with digital copy to boot!,1
I really enjoyed this very funny movie that has a pretty good story line and all with it I think just about anyone can enjoy this one.,1
"It is a hilarious movie, based upon a true story ( kind of).",1
Very funny actully funnier then I expected I will definitely recommend,1
Another good comedy to watch. Lots of laughs. Perfect for movie night with friends.,1
All the movies that I bought are very funny and I would definitely suggest anyone that likes to laugh to get.,1
Nice first date movie. The four main characters work great together.,1
I love Aubrey Plaza! This movie is so funny you will die laughing!,1
"This movie has it's ups and downs, but Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza make this movie more likable than it should be.",1
It is not one of his funnier movies. It is more about him finding love. It is okay if you like a little girly love.,1
This was a great movie. Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza are both hilariously funny actors. Zac Efron and Adam Devine were really funny too.,1
"super fun and funny movie! its a lil hard to believe anna k is a ""baddy"" but shes still funny playin it... made me laugh, so worth the watch",1
It was a very funny movie and very unexpected at times.,1
I love this movie it is hilarious! Aubrey Plaza is the best my fav in the movie! You won't be disappointed if you like the goofy raunchy type movies.,1
"It's funny, I laughed a lot. It reminds me of the American pie series and specifically American Wedding... Basically you have a couple of stifflers for brothers and they get a couple of female stifflers for wedding dates and let the tragedy ensue.",1
This is a funny movie and we had a few laugh while we watch it. The re-watch value is not very high so probably will not watch it again. But still recommend as a funny movie.,1
Movie is good and picture looks amazing on 4KReviews were good for this movie and it was funny,1

"Seriously one of those stupid, stupid, and stupid but extremely funny movies that you can just sit and laugh at. This is not cinema its just fun.",1

It was an ok movie. Not the best movie I've watched.,1
Funny movie but they used a few to many lines used before. Younger generation should have some new quotes to use,1
These two guys accidently find thier equals in creating mayhem and madness.,1

It has its moments to give you a laugh. Glad I didn't see in theaters,1
"I didn't think I would like this movie. I was so surprised at how funny it was. Don't expect your life to change after watching this, but do expect a good laugh.",1
Loved the movie it was halarrious. I've watched it a couple of times,1
This movie is hilarious! Definitely NSFW or your break!,1
This is a laugh out loud movie. So many hilarious scenes that are not overly done. Zac is a natural and Adam is the next guy to watch.,1
I thought this movie was going to suck and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't and it was actually pretty funny.,1
This was a nice simple comedy that I enjoyed. Fun to watch,1
Funny movie. Good price. A++++++++++++++++++++++++,1
"This is a very funny movie, but it was probably more of a Redbox movies versus buying and owning it.",1
Like most comedies now a days this movie can be ridiculous at times but its definitely fun to watch. Anna Kendrick is amusing and even in this role adorable. The 4 of them have a fun chemistry between them that makes it easy to watch. Enjoyable movie.,1

"What a comedy, bought it on its release date and watched it right away. I liked the preview and I wasn't a disappointment at all. Watched it a couple of times since I bought it.",1

This ceiling fan looks very pretty with its alabaster glass shade. The glass matches well the chandelier hanging in the same large room. The delivery was very fast.,1
"Progresso had a Meatball and Rice soup last year (2015) that Target carried in the Bay Area and I loved it, kept going back to purchase larger and larger quantities when I ran out. Then the weather got hot and I stopped buying soup. With winter again, I wanted that soup and couldn't find it anywhere. I was so happy when I found that Target.com had it and purchased more than a dozen cans. Much to my surprise, it's not the same recipe! The soup I had last year was tomato based and only had meatballs. This soup is also tomato based, I think. I couldn't quite tell because of how much oregano was in it. And it had chunks of chicken and bits of corn. It tastes so different from the soup from last year! I've decided to donate the rest of my cans to a food bank for the holidays and hope that someone else will like it more than me. Target.com had great prices and the delivery was incredibly fast. The cans of soup were wrapped in heavy duty plastic bags, somewhat wasteful but definitely helpful to prevent spills should any cans unexpectedly get punctured or damaged, although none were damaged. Too bad the plastic bags had some tiny holes in them, otherwise I could have put them to other uses as pet waste pick-up, oh well. So, overall, the soup was a disappointment but the buying experience was good.",0
great for a dollar but they are salty,1
Original Hawaiian punch is the way to go.,1
This is a great drink. My son drinks it. Just add ice.,1
good flavor good thirst quencher,1
good flavor,1
Too much sugar for me but my kid likes it!,1
Hawaiian punch is just great any ways I chose this item cause I enjoy the limeade tartness,1
It good,1
i buy it for kids at church,1
My husband loves this drink,1
"i love this juice. i love the lime taste, its not too sweet like the original fruit punch, and its a great bargain for the amount that you get. my daughter and i always drink it in like a week or less sometimes, its a summer time favorite.",0
"My kids love this flavor, they ask for it regularly.",0
Great tast and priced right,0
Great drink. My child loves it.,0
We love this drink the lower price at waltmart,1
How can you beat something that taste great and is easy on the pocket book Answer-you can't!,1
It's good.,1

We have been buying this punch for many years and it also comes in Light with less sugar which is great and tastes just as good!,1
My family loves this especially all the flavors. Great price and value.,1
This item was great for the kids.,1
I love this juice especially for parties the kids love it!,1
Great!,1
The whole family loves it!!!,1
DOESN'T REALLY WORK. SUPER MESSY/STICKY.,1
"I like these strips much more than messing with warm sticky applications and cloth strips. I found them to be ""ick""-free and I could keep using them as many as 6 times before there was too much hair. They are definitely disposables. All methods I've used so far leave the occasional hair to be plucked. The only real challenge is warming them up in the winter (by rubbing between your hands).",1
"These wax strips work better than Nads or Sally Hansen for upper lip waxing and don't irritate my skin as badly. When I would use Nads or Sally Hansen I would have a rash for days but figured that was better than a mustache. These cause me only a little irritation that subsides after a day. I have dark, thick upper lip hair and have to use these every 7-12 days to keep it under control. I'm so used to doing it that it doesn't even hurt anymore. Clean up is easy with the finishing oil. Only takes me about five minutes total to get the job done and the strip removes 95% of hair in one swipe. Then I get the rest with tweezers. One box lasts me about 3 months. I highly recommend these for the upper lip.",1
"Works well, easy to use.",1
This worked really well.,1
"My family and I absolutely love the first one. Seen it maybe 8+ times and still cracks me up. That said, after watching the 2nd one, we all thought is was a major let down. The humor was pushed and not natural. Used the grandmother way too much, and each time it wasn't funny, but was ridiculous. And this will be weird saying, but everything was too ""Greek"". Yes, we understand that the family is 100% Greek, but the movie made them out to be absolute idiots (their homes especially). In the last move, Toula ended up being a very strong character, but she is back to being frumpy again at the beginning of the 2nd movie and having to find herself again. The list goes on and on and there are just too many reasons to skip this movie. Go back and watch the first one, laugh and enjoy it, and don't ruin it by witnessing this disappointment.",1
"Unfortunately the movie critics were right on this. Considering how funny the first one was this was a complete disappointment Another case of ""sequel shouldn't have""",1
Very disappointing movie - do not recommend at ALL.,1
Unhappy that I can't return or view dvd out of $17.00,1
"This film should have stuck to the main characters and been about their daughter getting married. I did not care for the plot, it was boring!",1
"Weddings are a lot like me, taking on you, this Monday on Monday night raw",1
This was a horrible remake very very bad writing..,1
My fiance likes these movies for some reason. They are terrible.,1
"Of course the first MBFGW is a classic and I did not expect the 2nd to reach that height but still, it was a huge disappointment. The acting, the storyline, etc seemed contrived and forced. Sorry I bought it.",1
"Had a lot to live up to, plus it was 14 years after the original. Fiance and I had a little bad taste in our mouths. Laughed only a few times. Probably recommended as a rental, unless you're Greek.",1
"I did not like this as much as the first one, it was just kind of like a reunion show. It was just ok. I bought the movie for a friend that really liked it.",1
Not the best sequel but what did you really expect. The original was a breath of fresh air the sequel was trying to get the same breath when we already had the fresh air.,1
"I thought the movie was entertaining, it still focused on family but it was slow in parts.",1
this movie had nothing for me in it. purchased for a friend and did not enjoy it,1
"Nothing new, if you are a huge fan of the first you might like this. I felt it a waste of time.",1
"my wife loves the 1st movie, she was not impress with the sequel",1
"Saw the first one, enjoyed it. So got the second. Comedy too stupid.",1
gave it as a gift did not watch the first one do not plan on it,1
Glad there was a second movie. Not as good as the first but still enjoyable. Fun movie.,1
"Good movie,I didn't feel it was as good as the first one",1
"Not as good as the 1st movie...usually not an easy task to make a 2nd movie after 20 years & this had its moments but was just not as good as you hope it will be. This is one of those movies that probably will never be watched a 2nd time, unlike the 1st movie.",1
"I was really looking forward to this movie.The original is a favorite. This sequel had some fun tributes, so we enjoyed it overall. Sadly, the movie includes way too many quite unnecessary inappropriate jokes which I consider cheap laughs. I expected a cleaner show. It would have been better minus that.",1
It was ok. It is over rated. It is very hard to out due the first one.,1
Did not live up to original movie but was ok and I liked the fact the original cast all came back in and a funny movie thanks,1
This film is good but not as great as the first one. It did =have hits funny parts but it does loss the connection that you felt from the first one.,1
"Not as good as the original, but still entertaining",1
"While the film lacks a good premise and well, a good script, it was really great seeing the entire original cast come back together. It felt comfortable and happy. It's like being with your family. Plenty of laughs along the way too. A good little Saturday afternoon watch!",1
Sequels are rarely as entertaining as the original - this movie wasjust so-so,1
"Somewhat of a repeat of original, but stands on own. many good and funny parts.",1
Not as good as the first. About the same thing. Fair,1
This was a light and happy sequel. Those of us with Greek friends recognize the family bonds and close knit relationships seen in this community.,1
You don't need to be Greek to enjoy a classic Family Movie,1
My was pretty good. Not quite as good as I thought it was going to be.,1
Not as good as the first one funny but lack the punch of the orignal,1
"Entertaining sequel, not as good as Greek 1 but worth watching.",1
It was an ok sequel. Not as good as the first one and had a lot of the same jokes as the first.,1
The first was definitely better than this sequel. This sequel felt like it was trying to hard to achieve the same entertainment value of the first.,1
The movie wasn't as good as the first movie made. It was ok.,1
This sequel was not as good as the first movie. It was worth watching however.,1
I feel asleep watching this movie. Maybe it got better on the second half of the movie??? Never got around to watching it again all the way through.,1
"This movie is worth watching once, but it won't be a movie I'll watch over and over. It is better than most sequels though",1
Same relationships as with first movie which made this more interesting. Women definitely were funnier!,1
The problem with most comedy sequels is that they tend to hit the same comedic beats as the original. This movie is no different. It is still enjoyable and funny but not that different than the first one. If you really liked the first movie and want to catch up on the characters 10 years later then definitely check it out. If you did not enjoy the first movie you sould avoid this one altogether. My wife and I liked it but not nearly as much as the original.,1
"I was kind of bummed when I watched this film. I was expecting a whole different level of entertainment than what was given. It was a good film, but it was not as funny as the previews lead on and It was confusing.",1
"Less enjoyable than the first movie. Seriously, is John Cusack's hair still the same length?",1
"i really enjoyed the first one, the sequel was good but the first one was better",1
First one was better than this one. Great that all the characters returned. Story line was different but kept you watching.,1
"This movie was enjoyable, it was nice to see the old actors return again years later.",1
"This was a nicely done sequel to the original ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". It did a fairly good job of bringing the characters up to date in a believable manner. The plot, while not deep, was adequate to maintain the story line. This would be an enjoyable movie experience for those who enjoyed the original ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""",1
"This was an ok follow up to the original movie. It had some laughs and a few misses.Same characters and a bit of a message,It is a worthwhile watch !",1
"We loved the 1st movie, but we thought this was a big disappointment. Happy we didn't rush to see it in the theater.",1
"Personally loved the first movie of this series, still fun to see the entire cast back to play the sequel though!",1
I bought this for my wife who loved the original. But like most sequels it didn't live up to the original...we can't all be 'The Empire Strikes Back'. She said she did enjoy it though.,1
"enjoyable, good family movie or watch with a loved one",1
"Sequel to the original My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but not as funny this time around. Jokes feel stereotyped and plot line feels forced. Ok movie, but the first one was a lot better.",1
"Not as good as the first movie. Predictable, but enjoyable to see the familiar characters.",1
"Movie is ok - not as good as the first Greek Wedding. Worth watching once, but probably not worth owning. Seems forced",1
I was a little disappointed with the sequel. Had its moments.,1
This movie was good but not as good as the first one.,1
"I like the 1st one better, but this was still good.",1
I liked the movie and added it to my library as the sequel to the first movie.,1
Essentially a recycling of the first movie but still fun. Good to see all the original cast reunited for another go around.,1
"I was excited to watch this movie since I loved the first one. This movie fell a little flat. Jokes weren't that creative. Worth a watch when there is nothing else on, but this is not a must see movie.",1
Not as good as the original. Movie tries to recapture the original magic,1
"It's a nice sequel. It's not a bad movie, yet I am glad that I didn't spend a lot for it.",1
Enjoyable but not up to par with the original movie.,1
"Nia was good, however the movie itself wasn't as good as the first and the storyline was a little cooky.",1
Didn't use the same jokes as the original so that is a plus. But wasn't close to as funny this time,1
Bought this as a gift for my mom. She says it's better than the first,1
"Watch as the biggest Greek family gets back together for another comedic filled adventure. In his latest find Gus, the patriarch of the family, finds out that his marriage license was never signed and that he is not legally married. Watch the comical events unfold as he strives to get remarried while proving he is a descendant of none other than, Alexander the Great.",1
"Good follow to the original. Of course, seconds typically are not the best.",1
Started watching this movie but I couldn't get into it. Actually fell asleep during the movie.,1
"Great movie! Definitely worth the money! I just have one problem- when I recieved my movie, the Digital HD code did not work.",0
"Closed Caption not available. With the actors accents, it was impossible to watch and understand. What I did see/hear, I liked",1
"Entertaining, funny and true to the original movie. Not as romantic as the original but a worthwhile movie night for the entire family.",1
nice movie . to watch with the family.,0
"I loved it!!!! Windex stock should soar once again. This is the kind of movie I enjoy-light, funny, with excellent actors who really know their craft. There is enough horror, danger, and sadness in this world today. I will be watching this movie over and over. I predict there will be a number 3 Big Fat Greek Wedding movie to showcase the daughter's big day.",0
I LOVED THE FIRST ONE SO I HAD TO SEE THE SECOND ONE.,0
"Sequels are never as good as the originals, but this one was cute and funny",1
"Loved the first and enjoyed the second. Didn't see it at the movies, so glad it's out on dvd.",1
I sure hope I can keep up with all of the points I should be receiving.,1
If you liked the first movie you will love the second movie. All the cast have done a wonderful job making us crack up again.,1
"While not as great as the original, this witty film has plenty of laughs to offer! I just wish they had included more bonus features.",1
"As with most sequels, this one does not rate as high as the first one. However, the focus on family, heritage, and traditions is still strong, and to be admired.",1
"""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" is one of my favorite romantic comedies, so I had no doubts when the sequel came out in theaters. The romance between Toula and Ian is as beautiful as ever, and the addition of a daughter was a very nice touch.",1
Funny in a different way from the first movie. Good clean humor.,1
Watching this movie took us down memory lane. Watch it with old friends!,1
This was a great addition to the first My Big Fat Hreek Wedding. Would recommend it.,1
"Funny, good for a day when you just need to relax and laugh.",1
"This is a fantastic sequel. If you liked the first movie, you'll like this one.",1
"The price was ok, but not very easy to put on. That's why I only rated it a good.",1
I did enjoy this follow up film. It's not as funny as the first one. But it continued the story nicely.,1
Pretty funny..... Family comedy...... Worth watching,1
I liked that I got the digital version with my purchase cause I can put it on my iPad to watch when ever I want,1
"This is the sequel to My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The first was much more funny, but I liked this as well.",1
I really enjoyed this movie. It made my day. It made me laugh the people in this movie were funny.,1
"Not as good as the original, still have very funny moments.",1
Funny but not what we expected. Not as good as the first but ok,1
story was good ---should have been written after the first,1
"I didn't know if this would be a good watch, but it turned out to be a great movie.",1
I thought it was in inline with the first one watch and enjoy.,1
it still gave one good laughs.I love the actors and actresses.,1
"It's a decent movie, but it nothing will beat the original",1
Really enjoyed the first one so I knew I would enjoy the second!,1
"If you enjoyed the first one, you should certainly enjoy this sequel. I'd say besides a couple select scenes that you can fast forward through, this movie franchise is great to watch with the family!",1
This is a funny... My husband and I thought it was better than the first,1
"This was a funny movie. It wasn't as good as the 1st one, but pretty funny for a sequel. 4 stars...",1
"Great family movie that makes you laugh and get emotional at some parts of the movie. If you have a family, you can relate to some of it or help you understand what's kids growing up feel like at times. Great to get together with your kids or friends to watch and enjoy.",1
"The lovable, endearing, madcap characters from the original film are all still with us. This is a wonderful follow up, still fun, but it's tough to beat the original film. I still love having it in my collection.",1
"Purchased this for my wife, we watched it together and enjoyed it, but it was not as good as the first movie...",1
Purchased a copy to share with family and friends.,1
"It was. Funny and enjoyable to watch, I would recommend it to all",1
They picked the right time to bring back this storyline. The stories were heartwarming and they drew a nice conclusion to a crazy and loving family.,1
If you liked the first one you will like this one--lots of laughs.,1
A good comedy movie.it comes with digital hd also. A must see!,1
"It's just a fun story to have the whole cast back together. Blu Ray format not mandatory, but looks great!",1
"very, very good movie I highly recommend this movie for just about everyone to watch",1
I think the first movie was better but still great movie,1
"If you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this one. The first one was better, but this one was worth my time.",1
Let just say that the wife enjoyed it and thus it was good,1
Thought it was funnier than the first one. The bathroom scene was a riot!Wished it had more extras. The blooper reel was hysterical!,1
"Its not as good as 1 st, but still enjoyed it. Fun",1
My wife wanted to see this movie and after watching it I found that it was pretty good for a sequel.,1
This is a good sequel to the first movie. If you like the first movie it's nice to see how things ended up with the family,1
"Fun, light hearted comedy that makes me want to be Greek for a few days.",1
Liked it. I still thought the first one was better.,1
What can be said about sequels that hasn't already been said. A fun follow up to the original and it was great to see the entire cast return.,1
I liked the first My Big Fat Greek wedding movie and I liked this one also. They show the ups and downs of a close knit family. Funny movie!,1
Not as good as the first movie but was funny. I would recommend it,1

A follow up that did not disappoint. Felt like you needed to have watched the first Greek Wedding movie in order to truly enjoy the comedy of this picture.,1
Of course have # 1 so had to get the second movie.,1
"I bought this as a gift, so haven't seen the movie, but I heard that it is okay if you are a fan of the first one.",1
"This movie wasn't as good as the original as far as plot goes but I couldn't stop laughing. I am a lot like the character ""Ian"" in the movie in that I married into a Greek family. Both movies remind me of how it feels to be in this type of family with all the crazy things that go on. Over all, a very funny movie.",1
Not as good as the first one but nice to see our favorite crazy Greek family years later.,1
Was pleasantly suprised with this as it was a good 2nd movie.,1
I enjoyed the sequel to this very funny comical movie,1
Good sequel with plenty of laughs and includes the original cast.,1

"This is a quaint and entertaining, albeit not especially original, movie.",1
"Since we were highly entertained by the original movie, and that the sequel was comprised with the same actors/actresses, it was a no brainer to buy this DVD. It was nice to see familiar faces and elaborate on what had transpired over the years with everyone. I enjoyed the first movie best, but this one was still entertaining, and can be viewed as a stand-alone.",1
Not quite as good as the original but good enough .,1
It was great to see these characters again! Just as funny as the original movie.,1

This was a nice way to continue the story line. I enjoyed this movie.,1
"This one had extra cheese on top of a cheese pizza, but I still laughed, which is the most important aspect of a comedy.",1
"It took a long time to get to an actual sequel. They did have some off handed sequel or something, but this is the definition of a sequel. It was a good continuation of the first one. Having most everyone back was great and it seemed like the chemistry was still there. It was a good movie with many laugh out loud moments. We all need a little Greek in the family.",1
"This sequel is very cute. My 14 year old daughter, my husband, and I all enjoyed watching it together. We laughed a lot.",1

if you enjoyed the first movie you will like the second. light entertainment and an enjoyable flick,1
"This movie is funny and fairly clean. It is not as good as the first, in my opinion.",1
While not a good as the first one. it is still fun to watch. I love all the hart warming quirks from this family.,1
Would have been nice to find the original movie to watch prior to this one.,1
Plenty of laughs for your enjoyment. Great follow up movie from the first one.,1

"You won't go wrong owning this classic, funny movie. Loved both 1 and 2! Enjoy!",1
A follow up to the first movie. If you didn't watch the first you won't understand the jokes qin the second.,1
"Once we got a movie that worked ,things were great. First 3 did not play. Do not know what the problem was.",1

Ever since I watched the first one I wished they would do a sequel just to see what happens after. Glad they did even if they waited so long to do it,1
"My wife loved the first so had to get the second. This one seemed to go to dvd quickly, but it was worth the purchase, very funny! More of the Greek antics like the first. Part two is like a continuation of the first, funny.",1
Worthwhile sequel after waiting so long. Was glad to see the original cast return after so many years. For many people this chaotic and dramatic family is quite reminiscent of their own family. Lots of laughs interspersed and entertaining.,1
good sequel to original movie - recommended to all,1
It was a cute movie and built upon the comedy established during the first. If you liked the first movie then you will really enjoy this one. All the original characters were back and it was a lot of fun.,1
"I went into this movie not expecting much but thought if I enjoyed it as much as the last one, it would be worth my time. I wasn't disappointed. While much of the movie was anticipated, it was like visiting old friends.",1
A fun and enjoyable continuation of the story with the same crazy family dynamic.,1
Funny Sequel to the First! Nice to see returning Cast members!,1
The wife loves this movieShe has watched over four times already,1
"With so much time having passed, it's hard to believe a sequel like this would even be tolerable, much less good. But it is pretty good, in fact. It doesn't repeat too many old jokes, and that's for the better. The only moment that's truly cringe worthy is the moment where the entire family is out jogging to ""We Are Family."" Ugh! Beyond that, I liked the movie very much. Like the first, it's a great romantic getaway for you and the significant other.",1
fun and entertaining movie. a must watch with the family,1
Cute movie like the first. They kept the original Dancing Zorbas!!,1
"I went into this expecting that it would not be as good as the first... and it's not, but it was better than expected.",1

I would have thought that a sequel would never be as good as the Original but I was mistaken. You will love the movie,1
Fun for the whole family. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a good movie,1
Funny movie a great addition to the first movie. Recommend seeing Big Fat Greek Wedding 2st,1
"Not as good as the first, but still a great movie. They brought back the main cast and still got the same laughs. If you liked the first, you will enjoy this one as well.",1

"I saw this movie in the theater and knew I would bring it home when it was released on DVD/Blu-ray. Although the first film will be my favorite, I really enjoyed seeing the sequel. It was nice to catch up with the characters and see where life had taken them and see how they grapple with current issues and family drama. The film, the characters, the story were all easy to relate to and felt authentic (but perhaps a bit exaggerated for comedic/dramatic purposes). If you're looking for a feel-good movie with some ups and downs along the way, why not give this film a chance?",1
Love this movie and the great condition it's in. Staff was friendly and helpful,1
It was a great purchase you received two free movies,0

If you're a guy and you dislike ""chick flicks,"" but are getting pressure to watch one from your significant other, trust me, this is one ""chick flick"" I can recommend you watch.",1
A great movie and follows on from the original very well. Excellent tie ins and very funny.,1
The sequel was funny like the first one and did a good job continuing the story line when Toula's daughter was about to graduate from high school. A must own! All of the original cast are back for the sequel.,1
Just as fun as the first and a cute story! Keeps you entertained and still loving this family!,1
This movie is even better than the original. It is nice to have the options to watch the same movie on digital devices and on Blu-ray.,1

"Enjoyed it just as much as the first. Maybe more, as all the same lovable characters/actors returned with a few new ones..so it had a sense of familiarity and life goes on.

If you haven't seen the original...it's a must, however, you don't have to see it to enjoy the second.",1

I hope that there is a 3rd one. Love all the characters; so hilarious.,1
Enjoyed this movie as much as the first movie. Well done.,1

I had seen this movie in the theater and wanted to own it. As always I choose Bestbuy because they have good deals and are really good about having the movies I want. Specially new releases :),1

I love the first part and the second part so great i love it,1
"My wife was a big fan of the first one, and she really, really enjoyed the second one!",1

Another great but corny movie. Definitely a date night movie,1
Definitely a must watch. Has a good mix of romance and comedy.,1

Price was comprable to movies available for purchase on-line.,1
Funny and light movie. Lucked out and found on sale so even better!,1
Had the same comedy and unexpected things happening in just like the first movie - very enjoyable,1
This was a very good show saw the first one and had to have this one too. I actually bought 3 DVD's when I purchased My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2. Very good quality and a good price also.,1
"Dell Inspiron is great. Light, nice size screen. Aittle slow booting up but not an issue once on. Like windows 10> nothing really negative to say. It is strictly used for email and web access. Was a great price too!",1

This was actually pretty darn funny.Just put some Windex on it.,1

I loved the first movie. Still do. This one is funny in certain aspects. The grandma is still funny.,1
"great movie and great gift, very funny movie won't reget getting it or watching it",1
Its very rare that sequels to classic movies are better than their predecessors. Nia Vardalos the writer and actress of the movies brings the original cast back and comes up with original ideas that work.,1

"My wife and I greatly enjoyed the original MBFGK movie (many similarities to our multicultural marriage experience). I saw the sequel on a flight and decided to buy it for my wife. This movie is cute, but not quite as good as the original. However, still a very enjoyable film. Buy this movie!",1
I shot the aerial scenes from the beginning a of Chicago and they did a great job with the shots.,1

I usually find that sequels are not as good as the first movie but not in this case. MBFGW2 is hillarious! It makes me feel like my family is Greek too. We loved it! We had to watch the first one (again) and then the second. So far we've watched #2 3 times.,1
I loved the original movie and this sequel was amazing as well. Perfect movie when you need a laugh especially for anyone with a large family.,1

I felt it had the same great humor as the first one.,1
It just shows you how a family can grow up and still be close,1
I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel. It was as funny as the original. I know the TV version did not sell but I have to say it was because it was not written by Vardalos. The movies were written by her. Kudos to her for this work!,1
This movie is great and I love that Bestbuy has the lowest price for this item.,1
enjoyed the movie as much as I did the original one,1
Fun movie which you can watch with the whole family.,1

"Made me laugh and cry, what a good movie should do",1
"Now with a teenage daughter, Toula and Ian have even more laughable woes! A laugh a minute, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is a must see! Even a family secret that turns out to be a bombshell! Still, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is just as fun as the original!",1

"I like the first movie,I'm enjoy this because is family movie is very sentimental",1

This is one of the best comedies that John Goodman has ever done. It's great for you and great for the family. Guaranteed to make even an Englishman laugh.,1
"The heater only stays on for 2-4 minutes max, then it shuts off. The instructions on the sticker says that if it turns off, then unplug it for 30 minutes. So freeze for 30 and warm for 2-4 minutes, not ok. It's winter and my office door has to stay open to a long hallway, so I know it's not turning off because the room warm and cozy.",1
"When I bought it I thought it was great, but after only a few months it started turning off within minutes of turning on. I checked it over and see no buildup on the coils, have it in an open spot where it gets plenty circulation, but yet it never stays on for more than 3 or 4 minutes.",1
"Bought this heater tonight, plugged it in for a good 5 minutes and my whole power went out! Shame.",1
I just used a couple month and could not operating anymore,1
I bought this directly from company since it was out of season at Walgreens. The purpose was to plug it in under my desk at work to stay warm. The thing is so loud I cannot use it in an office enviorment without upsetting my coworkers. It sits inside a drawer in my desk at work. I am too busy to pack the thing up and return it.,1
"I have this space heater and it is junk! Turns on and heats up and when it gets hot, it turns off and will not turn back on! I have had many heaters and this one is not vry good!",1
The heater shut down after 2 minutes of use. The fan is loud. I'm not sure if it's a defective product.,1
This product was brand new and literally never worked once.,1
"This heater mostly blows air. It takes almost an hour before you feel the heat. The plug melted after owning for a month. It would be better for a very very small room , that is the size of a closet. I have to turn my television up to be able to hear over the noise.",1
This is a good heater. It's gets the room fairly warm. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"for extra heat near a desk it provides enough warmth, which is what I bought it for. I do have a complaint about the thermostat. It might as well just have an on off switch. When I turn up the temp until it turns on it never stops and if I back of the heat setting slightly it never turns back on.",1
"Not sure the thermostat works the way it should but, great for small area. Safe!",1
I wanted something small for the bathroom with a temp controler so it wouldn't run wild. But when it's really cold in the room and you turn up the temp controler just enough to make the unit come on it wouldn't turn off the first time but for whatever reason it is now working. It got hotter than the sun the first time though!,1
"It has been working well without any problem. Also it's very quiet. It has a auto-shut off feature when it reaches to the temperature. Auto-shut off comes with both good and bad. I use it in my office when it gets too cold. Since it automatically shuts-off, I'm afraid I might forget to turn it off when I leave my work. Besides it, it has been working well.",0
"i have been using this heater all winter (so far about 3 months) and it negates my need to run the hvac system all the time. i have a 1300 sq ft two story townhome and i keep it on the down stairs level, this fan forced heater keeps it comfortable and keeps the chill away.",1
I bought this heater to replace one in our cold bathroom. It works well but my wife says it's loud. It is quite small but the price is right and it is super easy to use. I purchased this specific heater because of the review in Consumer Reports and I agree with their evaluation.,1
"I enjoy this purchase, especially for the price. It works quickly, but just a tad on the loud side. It is still work the money.",0
"Great little heater. Knob is so easy to turn for my aging mother. The cord and unit stays cool after many hours of use. So portable- use it room to room. It heats up quickly., I shut it off a lot be cause it works efficiently within a few minutes..",1
I love this compact heater fan. It will heat up a small room in minutes. Bought one for my brother and myself. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
Love it for my office desk and keep it aimed at my frozen hands! Now I can type without being so cold:). Love it!,1
I have owned Holmes Compact Heater Fans for several years. I have been very pleased with the longevity of performance - have had them last for years in spite of almost constant use in the winter months. I use them in a camper as well as my house and office. They also put out a good measure of heat and the thermostats are great to adjust amount of output depending on amount of heat needed. The heater also runs very quietly. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
My late husband found this great heater at work and purchased one exactly like it. I am so thankful be did. I spend a lot of time in the master bedroom and it keeps it perfectly comfortable on days that I don't want or need to heat the entire house. I have had it now over three years and it's still going!!! Go get it!!!,1
I love my new personal heater. It works well at work when the air conditioner gets too cold!,1
I have owned this one going on 2 years and it works great. It will heat up a small room no problem. I only wish that the dial for having it come on and off wash easier to adjust..cause your guessing at it when you want it to .For example to run for 10 minutes then shut off and come back on. Holmes please put a model number on this so more people can find it. When you get this your going to say no way is this little heater going to heat up the room. One last thing I would say is that I unplug this heater when I leave the home and I would unplug ANY heater I purchased,1
I bought two more Holmes heaters after purchasing one in store! They are perfect and my boyfriend loved them. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"Got this item and works great, affordable price !!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I bought two one to take anywhere with me, very powerful and perfect in size This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
It heats a big room in my home with no problem. I have 2 of them,1
heats up the bedroom or part of the living room. Quiet and works great.,1
Est muy bueno y excelente para una oficina.,1
"I was not convinced at the first sigth, but when I saw it working, I got satisfied",1
I really liked it. Just the perfect size for my office. I am so glad I was able to buy online.. there were out of them here in Houston TX!!! because it is hot now.... so there's no heaters any where down here!!,1
"I bought it for the 1 song hoping there were others on it I would like, boy was I disappointed.",1
It's good just like the other albums though was expecting a bit more or a few unexpected things from the 4th album,1
"The new cd by The Script features some great music , some good music and some not so good music. If you are a fan of the Script you will probably enjoy it.",1
This was purchased as a stocking stuffer and was a duplicate gift that will likely be returned.,1
"the script are one of my fave bands and i really enjoy this album. the previous album was better but this one is very good as well. ""no good in goodbye"" is a great track",1
Nice record for a relatively new band. On par with their previous output.,1
I love that best buy still carries albums. Script is awesome,1
"I love the Script, this isn't their best work but it is good enough. I'm glad I bought it",1
"Just got this one still pretty fresh to me yet, but it is growing on me. There is a few songs that I know and like. Others I don't but so far not to bad.",1
The CD has nice sounding music on it if thats what you in to,1
Saw The Script over the summer with One Republic and they were awesome.,1
"In my opinion, their best yet! Much more like The Script's original style this album felt pleasantly natural. I was happily surprised by the subtle Irish flavor they incorporated into a few of the songs.",0
One of the best CDs I've listened to! Amazing band!,1
Great band from Ireland. This cd is right up there with previous cd's,1
We bought this cd for our daughter and she likes it.,1
Excellent music by excellent artists. Highly recommended.,1
This a great album. You can hear how much they've grown as a band.,1
love this group - all songs are great to listen to,1
"Not as good as the previous album, but not terrible. Would still recommend to friends and family.",1
"It took them long enough, but a great CD so it is worth it!",1
"I loved their first album, but not the next one. This album redeems the band with the song ""Superheroes"" and ""Army of Angels"" alone. Totally worth listening to the whole album as well.",1
This is one of The Scripts best albums. I highly recommend it.,1
The Script is a great band with a great sound who write meaningful songs.,1
The Script has another hit album out and it is SUPER!!!,1
The Script is one of the best bands to come from the United Kingdom in the last few years. Leave OneDirection and The Wanted for the tweens since The Script is for those with who prefer more profound music.,1
This album is as good as the first one. The sound is great.,1
"These guys continue to get better. Songwriting is fantastic, musicianship is second to none. Treat yourself and they will have you asking for more....",1
This is the second cd I have purchased and I like it,1
"This is a great CD overall, a good mix of slower and more upbeat songs. I fell in love with a couple of songs right away.",1
"I originally purchased for the song ""superheroes"" but have grown to love all of them. From ""where's the good in goodbye"" to ""flares"" this album rocks!",1
"Another great CD from The Script. If you like rock music, you will like this.",1
good music from a great band! album #2 is still the best imo,1
Love The Script and this album! Great music and would recommend it to anyone,1
I have never listened to a cd that I enjoyed every single song until now.,1
"This a great album. It is not their best, but very enjoyable.",1
"I own the first three The Script albums ( The Script, Science & Faith, #3) and I was beyond excited for another one of their albums. Over all I love the CD. The tracks are great, with 'Flares' being my favorite. It's beautifully written, with an equally beautiful message. I can easily see myself putting 'Super Heroes', 'The Energy Never Dies', and 'Never Seen Anything ""Quite Like You"" ' on repeat. The artwork on the cover is unique and eye-catching. The CD Itself is vibrant with the tracks written around it. The booklet has some amazing pictures of the band performing together, as well as interesting photos of each individual member of the band. My only problem with it is the lyrics are written fairly small, and are a little hard to read. Overall a great CD release, that I will have in my collection and will enjoy for years to come!",1
This is a great album. Haven't really ever heard anything from them that I don't like.,1
I have never been so excited for an album to drop. When they finally dropped this album I fell in love. There are so many songs that fit so well with life and things going on. Can't wait for another one!,1
"In my opinion, their best yet! Much more like The Script's original style; this album felt pleasantly natural. I was happily surprised by the subtle Irish flavor they incorporated into a few of the songs.",1
loved these for my snacking will be getting more will get other flavors,1
Very solid. I like this with salsa as well.,1
I love these bean chips.,1
Great with hummus!,1
"This shampoo and conditioner by Pantene's Expert Collection-Age Defy, left my hair with no volume and dull. I did not like it. My hair was flat and had no volume. I personally do not recommend it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
It smell different with Agedfy Shampoo I found. After blow dried ...it smells more worst. Did not like at all. The result was flat and fizzy. I would not buy this product. Sorry .... This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"It smells great and I love the texture, however, it leaves my hair uber-oily. I can't deal with it being so stringy after a wash. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Well, I definitely did not like the Pro-V AgeDefy conditioner. I was excited to try the pair of shampoo and conditioner together but was not overly impressed with the outcome of my hair. The conditioner not only smells like vitamins (not very appealing) but it left my hair limp and lifeless. I tried the conditioner with other shampoos thinking it might be the shampoo, but unfortunately I got the same results. Won't be purchasing this conditioner in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I tried the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner yesterday. While it as in my hair in the shower it felt creamy and smelled great. As it was drying my hair looked a little frizzy but still ok, but throughout the day my head started to have a slight burn and itch (I can still feel it today). It was fine before. And my hair feels drier and more coarse than it did before. My hair now actually feels crunchy. I swear it said conditioner on the bottle. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I've been using the Pro-V AgeDefy conditioner for a month now and I've literally noticed no difference in my hair at all. My hair is special it doesn't play nice with ANY shampoo or conditioner. Doesn't matter what the label claims, my hair won't do it. I've given up hope of ever having nice hair without having to beat it into submission. I will say that this conditioner is nice and thick, just the way I like it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
This is a nice basic conditioner. It smells good. It could be more moisturising though. I recently found out Pantene does tests on animals. That is something I avoid whenever I can. I wont be buying. I can easily find the same product without animal testing. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
When I first got this product I thought that the scent was a bit overwhelming but that didn't translate in the shower or on my hair. My hair is very fine and I don't have a lot so I don't use conditioner as the product just weighs my hair down. Testing out this product was the first time I've used conditioner in a LONG time. The product did leave my hair very shiny and smooth....I loved the feel of my hair. Unfortunately I find this product to heavy on my hair as it ended up flat and limp. I gave up using this product after two uses as I didn't like the look of my lifeless hair. I don't think this product is good for people with fine hair like me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"As for the conditioner I loved the scent it left on my hair. It felt very silky and soft when my hair was wet. But again, it made my hair way to frizzy like I just came out of a wind storm. As long as my hair was wet I was ok, but as soon as my hair started to dry game over my hair had a mind of it's own. I did have a nice shine in my hair and it did smell good, but otherwise it is a no go for me. But everyone has to try it so they came make their own opinion and decide for themselves. Pantene is a great product and I have used some of their other products before, but this one is just not for me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have been using the Age Defy line for about a month now and while I love the smell of the product (and the lather that the shampoo provided) I really cannot give this conditioner a great review. I felt that I really had to use a lot of it on my hair which is highlighted, a bit dry, thin and fine. I ended up finally purchasing a good finishing oil to get a result which I didn't have to do with my previous conditioner. Compared to other Pantene conditioners I have tried, I would give this product a miss. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I did notice it made my hair feel much softer and did notice less hair in the sink but I did find it very heavy compared to what I was using and it weighed my hair down. It didn't help with making my hair look full or the frizziness. All in all, it definitely made my hair smoother and more hydrated but it's not something I would purchase This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"So I have to do a second report as a follow up to my first. I have given this product the good old college try but have had to stop using. Although the conditioner makes my hair manageable and soft and the scent is very nice, I experience extreme flyaways after using so much so, that I must go two days (between hair washing) with very little interaction between my hair and a hair brush. I have moved to another conditioner and the fly aways went away. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"My husband and I use Pantene products regularly. This was our first time however, trying Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. Personally, I was not a fan of this product right from the start. I did not like the scent at all. It has a peculiar medicinal-like smell to it which put me off immediately. Also, I found that these products (both the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner) were too rich for my fine hair oily scalp. My hair was left lifeless, with no volume and unmanageable. I make an effort not to wash my colour-treated hair everyday to maintain the colour longer. This certainly is not possible with Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. By the second day after using the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was greasy, flat and smelled bad. Since this product was not right for me, I decided to pass it on to my husband who reports back to me that he likes Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner and will likely continue buying it. Although this product is not right for me, it did end up being a success for my husband. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I loved the smell of the shampoo and conditioner but I did not notice any difference with my hair. I don't normally use Panteen so I wanted to try it but I don't think I would buy it. I love my other brand better. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I've only been using this product for 2 week but surprisingly I have already seen some difference in my hair. It does feel and also looks lot smoother. I'm excited to see what difference there may be in another 2 weeks. I will buzz with an update. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I really was not impressed with this one I felt it made my hair dull after the first use.There was no harsh smell to it which was a plus but on the overall I would not purchase this. I would definately stick with the shampoo. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
It was alright. It smells nice and it works pretty well. It made my hair really soft maybe too soft though. I had a hard time styling my hair when it was dry. It was unmanageable. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I use it for one week but I didn't like the feeling in my hair ... but I pass it to my mother and she love it ! :) This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"BzzAgent offered to send me Pantene Pro-V shampoo and conditioner. I chose the Age Defy as the claim stated on the bottle is that it instantly restores youthful vitality. Sounded great, right When I received the bottle I noted that it stated 7 signs of aging hair: (1) breakage (2) split ends (3) frizz (4) unruly greys (5) lackluster colour (6) thin look (7) dryness My hair definitely suffers from breakage and split ends, and there are indeed a few unruly greys...perhaps a little more every day. The other issues weren't really a concern for me, but since it was sent to me for free I figured I'd give it a go. I was intrigued by the bottle. It didn't match it's shampoo sister. Instead of being tall and thin, it was almost conical, with the opening at the bottom. Very smart design as it allows the viscous product to settle down at the spout, and thus render it easier to squeeze out of the bottle. I also liked that the plastic was malleable, making it easy to dispense product. I was surprised that there was only 237mL of product in the condition, compared to the 285mL of shampoo since most folks tend to use more conditioner than shampoo. Like the shampoo, the conditioner has that typical Pantene scent, which I find pleasant and not overwhelming. It has a thick and creamy consistency which spreads easily over the hair strands, and combs through nicely withinthe shower. I always use both shampoo and conditioner so it is difficult to comment on how the conditioner works on its own. I can say that my hair felt silky smooth, which I suspect is due to the presence of silicone in the conditioner. My hair smelled great, but there wasn't any noticeable change. I still had breakage and I still had split ends, and my greys were just as unruly as they had been. All in all, I'm rating this conditioner 3 out of 5 starts. In my mind, it is pretty average. My hair felt smooth, but it became oddly subject to static electricity which I had not experienced prior. Like its shampoo sister, it left my hair smelling pleasant, but I hope most conditioners would do so. I would not go out of my way to pick up another bottle, but I would certainly use it again if it were provided to me. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"As a conditioner, the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy did not perform any better or worse than any other Pantene conditioner and the scent was nice. If I accidentally used too much, before the end of the day my hair would look greasy and stringy. Applied just to the ends and it left too many tangles to comb out. A full-sized bottle lasted almost an entire month and while I don't have super thick hair, I do have long hair and I wash and condition it daily. Overall, I would not spend the extra money to buy the Expert Pro-V line. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have been using the Pantene Pro-V age defy shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks now and though I love the shampoo the conditioner is not my cup of tea. First, it leaves my hair less desirable when it comes to trying to comb through my hair post shower but it is the scent that has me in a bother. It seems to affect my asthma and though I still use the shampoo the conditioner, for me, is out. I'll stick to my favorite Pantene conditioners and chalk this up as a learning experience. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"While I was disappointed with the Age defy shampoo from Pantene, the conditioner definitely ranks higher. The bottle design is great, and I am able to get every last bit of of it. The new design is definitely a plus. The scent is lovely too. Not over powering, but stays with me throughout the day. I have thin fine hair that falls below my shoulders, and a small dollop covers from root to tip. The coverage is great. Rinsing it out is easy, without the buildup or taking extra time to rinse. My hair feels softer, even when still damp. My brush goes through smoothly without much tugging or struggling required. I do notice I still have some flyaways after drying. It's still soft and supple though, which is nice. I will say, it didn't really meet all of the claims for Age Defy. However, I am definitely going to try the different Pantene products with the hope that age defy just want the right choice for my hair type. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I am trying the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo, as a BzzAgent. I receive the product for free, in exchange for my real and honest review. I have been using the Conditioner for only a few days, so will leave another review in a couple of weeks. My first impressions of the product is the packaging is nice, a sleek black bottle and their trademark gold lettering. But, I'm a little disappointed in the size...if it's a great product, I want it to last! After only two washes, I am starting to see that my hair is slightly less tangled when I brush it out, and my grey's seem to be slightly more manageable. Can't wait to report back after a couple of weeks of use! The only drawback so far, is that the scent of the shampoo differs slightly from the great scent of the conditioner. Wish it was the same (the shampoo smell is fantastic!) Thank you Pantene Expert ProV and BzzAgent! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I like this conditionner. I love how smooth my hair felt after just one use. My hair also felt strong and healthy. It worked fantastically well in detangling my hair (I have very frizzy hair). I just don't know that I'd recommend these products for people with very sensitive scalps because there seem to be a lot of chemicals in the products and it just smelled like candy to me. I usually have very sensitive skin in general (and scalp as well) but I didn't develop an allergic reaction to this conditionner, which is great. I don't know that I'd buy this product, because I felt very self conscious about the smell (it smelled like a very strong perfume, even after I'd washed it off!). I think I preferred the shampoo, but I will keep an open mind and try it a few times. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I have been using the product for two weeks and I like the way I can smell the conditioner right when I open the bottle. It feels soft in my hands. I like the way you don't need a lot to cover a lot of hair. It easily works into your hair leaving a nice sent and soft hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I really like how my hair feels after using this conditioner, with the shampoo. It seems resilient and strong. I will recommend to my sisters, for sure! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I find the scent a bit too strong. Thanks for the opportunity! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"As with the shampoo, the conditioner starts with a nice light scent, but has a strong chemical smell which stays until my hair is dry. The conditioner rinses out nicely, with no heavy oil feel, and my hair is clean and light! I like the way my hair feels! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1

"I have been using the AgeDefy conditioner for about a week with the matching shampoo. I love the scent of this line and really enjoy the light perfume smell that is left on my hair afterwards. It's not overpowering and very feminine. I like the texture of the conditioner. It feels hydrating without being too heavy and hasn't left my hair feeling frizzy or dry. On the other end up haven't felt like my hair gets greasy quickly or is weighed down so it seems like a well balanced conditioner. I have long fine curly hair and this condioner worked very well for me. I will still supplement with a weekly hair mask, but it leaves my hair supple for the whole week. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have only been using Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner for a week, but I have already seen results. I have very fine hair so conditioners have always made me nervous. They often leave my hair looking rather limp and dull. Once I tried this (small amount) I was hooked. It's a nice thick consistency that seems to stick on the hair without seeping to the roots and causing that limpness I often found with other products. It rinses out nicely and leaves you with tangle free hair. I love the smell of the conditioner. It is a light fresh scent, nothing overpowering, which was a nice surprise. Overall, I am very happy with this product and would buy it again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I tried out the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner from their Expert line for about 2 weeks. I have fine, wavy hair with a dry scalp and split ends. I found that the conditioner did a really good job of helping with my dry scalp and giving my hair more volume. I also found my hair to be smoother and softer. The product is also a very nice consistency and has a neutral scent. The only issue I had with this product is that after using it, my hair became greasy much faster than normal and I have had to wash it much more frequently. As I all ready have dry hair and split ends, this isn't the greatest but otherwise it is a good product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Some people choose Botox for their face to make them feel young again, some choose transplants, I choose Pantene Age Defying Conditioner to make my hair look and feel younger! It leaves my hair strong and shiny. No greasy oily feeling with the conditioner, nice and creamy and clean feeling. smells good too! My hair feels clean and hydrated. I was having issues with my hair falling out and it looked as though my hair was the new carpet for the shower floor, now my hair is nice and thick and on my head! definitely suggesting this to my friends! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I received my bzz kit with my Pantene age defy conditioner and shampoo to try! I found the conditioner to be nice, rich and creamy. It smells nice but not my favourite of scents because I'm not a huge fan of the smell of coconuts. It detangled my curly hair easily. After I blowed my hair I did notice that I had less fly away hairs and less frizz! I also noticed it tammed down my grey hairs, and my hair felt silky smooth! I am pleased with this Pantene age defy shampoo and conditioner and would by it if the price is responsible! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I loved the scent of this product as soon as I opened the box. The packaging and formula looked and felt professional, like a higher-end salon product. Even the weird brown colour of product lead me to believe maybe there was some sort of colour or anti-aging ingredients in it, but probably just a marketing decision to not alter it or to make it look like it contained Olay. Both the shampoo and conditioner were very moisturizing. They made my hair a bit on the limp side, but it air dried and blow dried very nicely. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I tried the AgeDefy conditioner and was actually pretty impressed with how smooth and soft it makes my hair feel in comparision to what I was using. I have been using for over a week now and it seems to be also helping maintain my colour. I have noticed however that my hair is very fly-away over the past few days difficult to know if its just the return of cold air or the conditioner. Will have to keep an eye on it. I do really like that this product is thick and stays on the hair when applied in the shower. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"Wow so glad I got the chance to try and review this conditioner, I have had a chance now for the last week to use the conditioner with the corresponding shampoo and I must say I love it. The look of the bottle is appealing, the conditioner smells great and my hair feels so soft. My hair hasn't felt as greasy towards the end of the day if that makes sense to everyone. I am looking forward to how many more benefits I will see in the coming weeks using the rest of my bottle up, this is definitely a product I will continue to buy This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I love the way that this product feels on my hair in the shower. It rinses really well too. I found that it works/looks best if you blow dry your hair it doesn't look as 'fresh' if you let it air dry. I have had a lot of people comment on how good my hair looks. It is a challenge to keep your hair looking good when you don't use any styling agents outside of shampoo and conditioner. My husband has also commented on how much fuller my hair looked with this product. After all, who doesn't like a compliment This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I really liked this product! I've been having problems with tangles in my hair and conditioner not properly coming out of my hair in the shower. I have to say this product solved both of these problems. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to protect or even repair their hair. It leaves your hair soft and manageable!

"I have been using this conditioner for a few weeks. Nice conditioner, smells good. It's difficult to say if this conditioner is any better or worse than any other conditioner. It is decent, but I cannot say that I have noticed any difference in my hair since using it. I have long colour treated thick, naturally curly hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Thanks to BZZ agent Jono for sending me the shampoo and conditioner. This conditioner made my hair smell divine, but I wouldn't recommend for anyone with curly perm. Also gave this to my friend who has straight hair and she loved the look and feel of her hair after using this product for the last 2 weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I really liked the conditioner for the smell and how it went on. It helped to squeeze out my hair thoroughly first as I found it a bit thin on my very thick hair, but as long as I used enough, I found that it was great for making my hair look healthy and lustrous and also tangle-free!

I have been using the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner for a couple of week on my short white hair.

"Hello, I have used Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner together with the sampoo and i think that they are working great . My damaged and dry hair who is and very frisky also have changed , after 4 utilisations, his aspect, it looks healthier and stronger. I am very curios if in time the hair will look younger and maybe stronger. I think you have to use both of the products to have real results. I realy like both of them, They have a really richness that makes you use them daily . This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy Conditioner left my hair shiny and smelling great. It spread through my hair and detangled quite well. It rinsed out and did not leave any residue behind. My hair air dried with no frizziness and when blow dried it was smooth and glossy. I liked the thick texture. I would recommend this conditioner for people with thicker or coarse hair like mine. I really liked trying this conditioner. GotItFree Pantene This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I used the shampoo of course the next step is condition :-) The Pro-V Agedefy conditioner has a nice smell the formula didn't weigh my hair down at all as some conditioners can do. I don't tend to use conditioner everytime I shampoo as I have very fine hair some conditioners can create a build up. The Agedefy did not seem to do this at all left my hair bouncy with volume. Would I buy this after using it A resounding yes! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I have been using this conditioner for the past 2 weeks thanks to Bzzagent. I only used it after using the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo. This is a great conditioner! The hair is so easily brushed after the use, it's great! And it doesn't tangled easily for the following days so I like that. I only pass my fingers in my hair to apply the conditioner, let it sits for a bit and then comb my hair and I have no knots! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"The Pantene Age-Defy Conditioner worked well with the shampoo of the same name. I have dry, brittle grey hair and the conditioning made if feel quite a bit softer. I liked the thickness of the conditioner, it did not run down your face/head while leaving it on which is nice. The scent is nice but a bit strong. I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry, grey hair. You will like the shiny, soft results. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I think this is a very good conditioner. It comes out of the tube like a rich, creamy moisturizer and smells fantastic. I have been using Pantene products for years, but I have used this conditioner for about two weeks. For starters it is way thicker and more luxurious than other conditioners. Some conditioners are watery and runny. it lathers up really well and then washes out completely without leaving any residue that can weigh hair down. My biggest issues are aging hair, including unruly greys, lackluster dyed hair and dry hair. My hair is also naturally wavy and can get really frizzy, especially in the dry, cold Canadian winters. This conditioner addresses all these issues. My hair is soft and manageable and feels moisturized and well nourished. My scalp is not dry or itchy. My hair has a lot of bounce and movement in it. It is bright and shiny and healthy. It is now more like my 19 year old daughter's hair. I like this product and will continue to use it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I've been using this product for about a month, and it does live up to some of its claims. One thing that stands out in particular is the fact that it tamed my grays. It didn't do anything miraculous, like prevent those suckers from growing in the first place, but it did keep the wiry hairs from sticking up like a beacon of my impending old age. Another surprising quality was that it detailed my hair nicely. A brush would just glide through, even when wet. Finally, as a girl who only washes her hair 2 to 3 times a week, this conditioner kept it from getting too oily too soon. Unfortunately it did dry out my scalp, or perhaps that was the shampoo's fault. I would not repurchase this product as it contains too many ingredients that I can't pronounce, however, I will keep what's left in the bottle and use it once a monthwhen my hair needs extra detangling, or when those nasty gray hairs pop up and need a little taming.

"I reviewed Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner through BzzAgent, these opinions are my own. Following on the heels of another hair product that left my hair quite dry, I was a bit nervous that this too would leave my hair wanting but I was pleasantly surprised. The shampoo seems to be really gentle and fortifying and the conditioner adds new moisture and shine with lots of body to boot. The scent is pleasant and light and not noticeable in my scent free workplace. I believe that this product can Defy age as well as the environment, heated hair appliances and all the rough stuff that life throws at our hair. Additionally, I found that while using Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner, my usually mischievous and unruly hair, really behaved nicely, it seemed calmer, more relaxed. This is a product that I will certainly continue to use and recommend to others. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"About 18 months ago my hair started to look damage. I had never given much thought to my hair. I had never had problems with it. I thought the damage was due to stress and my hair dresser agreed. I have tried so many different products during this last year and 1/2 with nothing helping. After starting to use Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner I have really noticed a change. Now when I feel my hair it feels silky and doesn't feel brittle. Before I was afraid to brush it or blow dry it too much, now I can't wait to style it and show it off!!

"Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy Shampoo and Conditioner Thanks to BzzAgent and Pantene, Im trying this product for free!! First impressions mean everything! When I opened up my kit I immediately noticed the new sleeker bottle design. The slender black bottle has a no-fuss appeal and a higher end look and feel to it. Next came the scentAMAZING! It has an expensive salon smell, definitely not what I'd expect from a product you can buy at the drugstore. I have very thick long curly hair and finding a shampoo and conditioner that works for me is tough, to say the least. Lately, my hair has been showing the tell-tale signs of aging, dry, brittle, breakage, split ends, pesky gray hairs that pop up and scream 'YOOHOO, LOOK AT ME!' and, of course, dreaded FRIZZ. The biggest issues for me are all of the above so I was excited about trying out a product that claimed to be concocted to tackle all of my hair woes. So lets do it!! I've used this product for a little more than two weeks now and so far I'm thrilled. The shampoo has a thick and lasting lather. I could almost feel my hair getting thicker as I worked the lather through my hair. I was anxious to see how the conditioner would stack up. The thick creamy consistency is exactly what you want out of a conditioner. I worked the thick cream through my tangled mass of curls and then I waited a few minutes before rinsing. Wow! Huge impact! Manageable and easy to untangle, my hair looks and feels so soft and silky and the breakage issue is well on its way to being non-existent. Then theres the gray hair issue, they are now blended into my hair and not sticking up. I actually had to look for graysso much less noticeable! Damaged aging hair is no longer the first thing I see in the mirror. I would highly recommend it to friends and family and I will definitely continue using Pantene Pro-V Age Defy. Very well done Pantene! GotItFree This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I'm absolutely changing my hair care routine to include Pantene's Age Defy Shampoo Conditioner! Since I've started using them (about 2 months ago), I've noticed the look AND feel of my hair change dramatically. It's softer, easier to manage there's no residue left from the shampoo/conditioner. You can visibly see the differences as well - my hair doesn't have those frizzies it's healthier looking (has a beautiful shine). I'm really impressed! Another huge benefit is that I don't need as much conditioner (you can really tell the quality) as other brands I've tried. If you have hair issues, you MUST give Pantene's Age Defy a try!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I've been trying Pantene Expert AgeDefy conditioner for about 2 weeks thanks to BzzAgent and I'm very happy with the results. The conditioner comes in a sleek bottle and the scent is the same as the AgeDefy shampoo (pineapple coconut like). Although the colour of the conditioner is pretty bland and unappealing (reminds me of cement paste), it does the job and leaves my hair smooth and soft and silky! No tangles or knots for me! I'm very happy with how the AgeDefy line is keeping my flyaway grey hairs in check (at least 80 better than before I tried this product). Would definitely buy this in the future. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have been using the age defy conditioner for a week now and my hair has never felt so soft and manageable. I was skeptical at first about using this new conditioner as my hair is thick and curly and hard to manage. After a week of using this product I am now a pantenr age defy fan! My hair has more bounce and shine than it has in years. I tend to have doing my hair as it looks flat and frizzy or like a poodle getting blow dried. But after using the conditoner my hair feels and looks great. Now I love doing my hair and showing it off!! It's shiny, bouncy and makes me feel like a teenager again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy Conditioner is perfect for me. I love how it feels when you put it on your hair. I love how my hair feels after I have used the shampoo and conditioner. I have tried a lot of different conditioner and this is the best I have ever used for my hair. I have dry, frizzy and damaged hair. This new formula from Pantene takes care of the 7 sign of aging hair. 1 Breakage, 2 Split Ends, 3 Frizz, 4 Unruly Greys, 5 Lackluster Color, 6 Thin Look and 7 Dryness. Totally 100 satisfied with this Condition. It is now my new go to !!!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
Great product it helps how my hair feels after color,1
"I have been using Pantene Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner for about a week , and I absolutely love it. You really don't have to use a whole lot to get great coverage, which impressed me immediately as with other products you usually need to use twice as much conditioner as shampoo. I only left it on a few minutes and after rinsing there were no tangles and my hair felt silky but not weighed down. After drying it was shiny and frizz under control. Even when I woke up the next morning it still wasn't tangled or frizzy. Love this product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"What a difference this conditioner makes to my hair! I noticed a change in my hair the very first time I used it. It is the best treatment I have ever used for my hair. By using this conditioner, my hair has life once again. It is fuller and brighter and so easy to style now. I have been colouring my hair for years now and this has been really hard on my hair. But by using the Pantene Pro-V age defy conditioner it has restored the luster in my hair. It no longer looks drab and flat. I recommend this product to all women colouring your hair. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"This conditioner is wonderful! It makes my hair feel like it just received a leave in treatment without the residue. I dye my hair every 4-6 weeks and sadly, it was showing. This conditioner has brought life back into my hair that I havent seen in many years. Its soft, shiny, manageable and it gives me confidence. I will definitely be buying the Age Defy Conditioner in the future! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
Fantastic products,1
"I loved the Age Defy conditioner. It smells great and not too strong. The scent lingers, but isn't over powering like some conditioners. It rinses out easily and leaves hair feeling soft and smooth. I was surprised how soft my hair felt after just one use. It even helped tame my unruly greys and minimized my frizz. Love how shiny my hair is now! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
This conditioner works wonders on dry frizzy hair. Even as I was rinsing it out the first time I could feel the difference it was making. My hair is soft shiny and smooth even after the 1st use. It also smells like salon quality products. I would suggest using it sparingly as you don't need a lot of this conditioner to get great results. I am definetly buying this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I loved this conditioner! I normally have a hard time finding a conditioner that doesn't leave my hair looking greasy and limp, but not with this one. It gave me shine, body and made my hair feel thicker, which is great considering I seem to be losing more hair lately. In combination with the shampoo my hair looks and feels great. I will definitely buy this conditioner! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"This conditioner has left my hair feeling really hydrated without the feeling of heaviness or greasiness. It has been a great addition to the AgeDefy shampoo from the same line, in helping my hair look healthier and shinier, giving it some life back. My hair also feels softer to the touch and no longer crisp and dry like it had been all winter long. Great product! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Pantene Dry Defy Conditioner absolutely made me love the look and feel of my hair. As someone who struggles with dry hair, I couldnt be happier that I was able to try this product.

"Received this product, had to wait to try this item as well but so glad i did. Awesome experience using this in my hair. Smelt nice felt nice and my hair looked and felt awesome after. Didn't have to wait long for the conditioner to do its job before rinsing out. When all dry and styled it felt even smoother then usual. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
This is great for hair over 50! My hair had lost some of it's luster and body as I aged. A friend recommended this and I was amazed after the first use. Used as my regular products keeps my hair looking healthy and beautiful.,1
Cant' say enough about this product. Absolutely love it! My hair was so smooth and silky after using this product. It went on smooth. Rinsed out well and the brush just glided through my hair. My hair was manageable and soft and smooth. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Will definitely be buying more when this runs out. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I have long and frissy hair, always have hard time to fix it. This product worked the first time i try it! It leave the hair silk and smooth, easy to fix. The conditioner is a must! You can feel it work in the shower. I have been dying my hair for several years, leaving them damage and dry. The conditioner make it glow again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
This is thick stuff! I was surprised by the consistency of the conditioner. It was A LOT thicker than my usual products. But it WORKS. I have relatively dry hair that often requires heat styling to appear shiny. Not with this product. My air dried hair was ready to go. IMPRESSIVE! I will continue to use this for sure.

"I have used this conditioner before. I like the fragrance and the feel of my hair after using it. The fragrance is light, it rinses out without leaving a heaviness or greasy feeling in my hair. But used with the shampoo together is like magic! My hair has a much better texture and is silky smooth and shiny. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"PANTENE Expert Pro-V AgeDefy conditioner really softened my greys and made my curls easier to to manage. The brilliant marriage of PANTENE and OLAY created a conditioner that may not appear special but after one use, I was impressed. My mature hair felt soft and healthy. Don't let the dreary packaging or blah colour of the conditioner fool you. This is good stuff!! I have always trusted Pantene and now I have new conditioner created specifically for my hair type. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"So, I'm a little obsessed with conditioner. I pretty much need to use it during every shower or bath. Most conditioners are decent, they do the job and get my hair untangled pretty well which is what I typically want. THIS conditioner though, goes over and beyond that. After I use it and get out of the shower, my hair is surprisingly smoother than usual and looks super shiny. I love it. I have natural waves and it totally brings them out. And it smells amazing!

"I've been using Age Defy - Pantene Expert Collection conditioner for 2 weeks now and my hair is literally coming back to life! It feels so soft and is shining now and also feels stronger, the conditioner is super tick creamy and i use a lot less amount than i used to with another competitive brand, instantly since the first wash i was able to see difference in my hair, I'm loving having a salon quality shampoo at a affordable price and that actually works! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I really did enjoy this conditioner, more than any other one that I have tried in the past. It left my hair smelling great, but also left it feeling very soft and silky. Before I received this product, I struggled with dry lifeless hair, but now my hair is always looking very soft and full of life. This past month I have used this conditioner in combination with the shampoo, every single day and I have not been disappointed in anyway. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have been loving my Age Defy conditioner. I have been using it regularly along with my Age Defy shampoo, for the past three weeks. My hair was dry and damaged before, it wasn't very full either. Since using this shampoo, my hair is looking great. It is much healthier than before, I notice the difference both in touch and look. It is also fuller now, not so limp and dull like before. It it silky smooth in my hair and smells great. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have thick dry curly hair that's prone to dryness, split ends, and breakage, and shedding. This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny, conditioned but, without a heavy waxy buildup like other hair products. I also love the soft, grown-up scent it leaves on my hair...I'm not a fan of the powerful fruity scents so popular today.",1
"YAYHOO! Finally got the Pantene Pro-V AgeDefy ShampooConditioner. Wow, aaammmaaazing! I had to immediately open it up and get a good wiff of it to get an idea of what my hair will smell like. You know what I'm talking about! Had to smell the conditioner too, mmm smells soo yummy! Smells coconutty, like suntan lotion! The following day I had plans to meet up with my mom for lunch. The day of my lunch plans, that morning, I grabbed my towel, my Pantene Pro-V AgeDefy shampooconditioner. Got water to temp and wet hair. Squeezed nickel size amount of shampoo as I have long hair. Lathered shampoo into hair and the amount was plenty enough for my head. It rinsed out so clean, it actually squeaked! Next I used the conditioner, same amount as I used with the shampoo which was plenty enough to saturate my hair and scalp. After rinsing all the conditioner out, wrapped hair in towel to soak up excess water! After removing towel and towel dried hair I looked at hair it looked so shiny. It felt so clean and light! Most conditioners don't rinse out clean and your hair feels heavy and afterwards my hair looks greasy! Brushing it was so easy, so smooth and silky! No knots to fight with and loosing a handful of hair. I blow dried my hair and OMG, it felt even lighter! Wasn't sure if I had hair on my head! LOL! It was light and fluffy. Felt like I had just got out of my hairstylist chair! My hair flowed with the wind, it felt so good! I must say that I am extremely happy with Pantene Pro-V AgeDefy ShampooConditioner and will be buying it as my new hair care products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I received Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy conditioner from BzzAgent and I love it. It has a nice light scent. I have long hair so I use about the size of 2 loonies in my hands and work through my hair which was washed with Pantene Pro-V Age Defy Shampoo. I leave on for about 2 minutes and then rinse off. It leaves my hair feeling soft and shiny like it did in my teen years. I highly recommend this product for anyone 40+. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
My hair hasn't been cut in 2 years and very damaged from at home colouring. I wanted a shampoo that doesn't weigh my hair down but conditions and Repairs it! I found it.

This conditioner smell amazing it actually makes your hair look younger. If you are looking for that youthful glow all the little kids have this will help you achieve that. My hair was dull and dry looking with in a few washes it looked and felt great. It felt softer which is hard to do with grey hair. My husband even commented that he liked my hair. Thanks Pantene and Bzzagent for letting me try it. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I had not been a huge fan of too many Pantene products in the past so I was a bit skeptical about this new formulation but man was I wrong! Pantene's new Pro-V age defy Conditioner formula is wonderful, I absolutely love it, they got it right this time!! I found that it was a very moisturizing formula without adding any heavy residue. My friends I absolutely loved the way my hair looked. I definitely got LOTS of compliments! I loved the shininess and bounce and when I touched it it was sooooo soft. My hair also smelled amazing, the perfume was similar to that of a brand that is very expensive and people thought that's what I was using! I was very impressed, especially because the great results seen were after the first use( i.e results were immediate). I would definitely recommend people give the new Pantene Pro-V age defy conditioner a try if they feel that their hair is looking a little lifeless, dull and dry, it is just the pick me up it needs!

"This conditioner is the best for my thick curly hair. It moisturizes without weighing down or leaving greasy. Having a hard time finding it in stores, please do not discontinue and put our a big bulk pump bottle!",1
"Ok, so what goes with a great shampoo...but a great conditioner! I tired the Pantene Exper ProV AgeDefy Conditioner. The conditioner claims to fight the seven signs of aging: 1. Breakage, 2. Split Ends, 3. Frizz, 4. Unruly Greys, 5. Lackluster, 6. Think Look, and 7. Dryness. Once again the company delivers on what they are promoting with the conditioner. It has helped my hair to regain the shine, tame the fly aways, and help with the split ends, breakage, and to make my hair look fuller. Now what I did find with this conditioner is if I didn't use it every day my hair was built up with static. I like to be able to use conditioner every other day or every two days. So this was a bit of a disappointment to me that I would get static in my hair because I didn't use the conditioner. So if you are someone who doesn't use the conditioner every day, maybe take this into consideration. Thanks BzzAgent for the campagine. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the smell of the product. It smells crisp and refreshing. The best thing about it is that it lasts for a while too - my husband told me my hair smelled good and I was on day 3 hair! When testing a conditioner, I look for 2 things: 1 is how slick it feels in my hair and 2 is if/how much it weighs down my hair. I have very fine and thin hair so any extra weight is a big no no! This conditioner is quite thick in consistency but blends into the hair surprisingly well. It gives just the right amount of slickness to allow me to de-tangle my hair with my fingers only, without feeling like I'm pulling too much or causing any damage. It rinses out well and my hair doesn't feel weighed down once I blow dry it. This condition in combination with the Age Defy shampoo has been my go to combo in the past few weeks. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Today I tested out the Pantene Pro-V Age Defy conditioner. As I had reported in my review of the matching shampoo (Age Defy), I was a little hesitant at first to use this line as I did not have good experiences with some of Pantene's other shampoos and conditioners. I found some of Pantene's other conditioners to have too strong a scent (and not a pleasant scent in my opinion), as well as weighing my hair down. Just like it's matching shampoo, the Age Defy conditioner had a pleasant smell that was not strong at all. With my fine hair, the conditioner gave my hair some nice volume and bounce. It did not weigh my hair down. My hair looks smooth, not frizzy. My scalp isn't dry or greasy after using it. I am usually quite picky with my hair products and this one may be one to add or replace my usual ones! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I really like the shampoo and conditioner from this collection. It smells absolutely fantastic and makes my hair feel amazing. My hair has been really dry and has just been looking dead lately. I have to constantly condition my hair as well as apply a variety of hair masks. After using the age defy conditioner I can confidently say that my hair feels younger, softer, so shiny and alive. It made my hair a lot more shiny and bouncy, no more dullness. I have very thick and long hair and it is hard to find something that works this well in terms of keeping it looking fresh. I used the conditioner similar to a hair mask and left it in for a few minutes before washing out and it definitely made a difference in its productivity. I highly recommend this and will definitely go out and buy another bottle. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I love this stuff. Wowza. It's thick out of the bottle. I'm talking THICK. But it covers so well, so a little goes a long way. I assume you're all like me. I put conditioner on my hair, and then I tend to other things, like shaving or brushing my teeth. A lot of other conditioners end up running down my face (yikes) or drips into my eyes (ouch) or completely rinsing out of my hair without me ever touching it (boo). Not this stuff. It smells phenomenal, and is soooooo silky. It makes a big difference in blow drying my hair too. I have fine, dry, broken hair. I always have a halo of hairs that stick up from my head caused from breakage. Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy Conditioner actually MAKES THEM LAY DOWN. I can't tell you how happy that makes me. This stuff is legit. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I'm usually very picky with the conditioner I use on my hair so was hesitant to try Pantene's Expert-Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner, but was certainly glad I did! For those who don't like strong fragrances, you will love the light, natural, floral vanilla like, warm scent of this conditioner. It is nice and thick, so a little will go a long way. I also love how the container is a tube that stands on its cap so the product is always available to be squeezed out. It rinses out without leaving a heavy residue and in the two months using it, my hair always feels strong and full of volume. After two months, I still have 3/4 of the tube full, so happy it will last a long time! I will definitely buy this conditioner again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I've tested Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner (along with the Shampoo) now for the last month. While i think that the Shampoo is only ok, i love love LOVE the conditioner. Both products have a chemical smell reminiscent of a hairdressing salon. While i'm not willing to overlook it for the shampoo, the conditioner is fantastic. It's thick (hold upside down in your hand and it doesn't move thick) and you only need a small amount to smooth out your hair. i love it! However... did it smooth out my wiry grey hairs no. did it smooth out the rest of my hair and make it fall smoother and bouncier yes. Would i purchase this yes, in a heartbeat. it would make a great conditioning treatment. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"As a Bzz Agent, I received a full size bottle of Pantene Expert Pro-V Age Defy conditioner to test and review. About 25 of my hair is grey, and the grey is thin and pretty unmanageable, while the rest of my hair just simply has lost its luster. I am very impressed with this product. After the first application, I realized that I only needed a small amount of conditioner compared to other conditioners. My hair now looks and feels stronger and healthy, while my grey hair is soft and manageable. The fragrance is subtle, and I now have soft and shiny hair once again. This product actually works better for me than much more expensive products I've purchased through salons! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I love the Pantene Expert Age Defy conditioner! It has a very pleasant scent and is very thick, so it was easy to work through my long, straggly hair. It was a bit difficult to rinse out because it was so thick, but my hair felt silky soft even while wet. After air-drying, my dry, unruly, coarse hair was soft, manageable and laid down quite nicely. I have severe trouble with frizz and this helped much more than other conditioners. It claims to fight the seven signs of aging hair, but my hair has only 3 of these: frizz, unruly grays and dryness. This conditioner did a nice job on those and, since the Age Defy worked so well, I'll try to the Intense Smooth in the Expert line next. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
I think this is one of the best conditioners I have used out side of a salon. When using this product I compared it to a salon product that I had been using. It had a thick feel to it and with fairly short hair I didn't need a huge amount for my hair. After washing it then using the conditioner and drying my hair I had less fly aways and very little frizz in my normal day. I am very pleased with this product and I wouldn't leave it on the shelf at the store. It is worth a little extra to get the great way my hair feels soft and frizz free with very little other products needed to keep my hair in check. Let you know how it goes in the coming days as I keep testing this product. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1

"I love this stuff I dye my hair and the ends get dry, but this is the conditioner that fixes it.",1
Love it after the Age Defy shampoo. I usually use a leave in conditioner even after I use the other brands conditioner but this time it was not necessary. I am very happy with it. Great value too.,1
"So far I am very pleased with the way my hair is behaving. It feels fuller, it manages better, and I do see and feel a difference. I am so glad I gave it a try an do plan to stick with it for a while to see if it works long term.",1

"I actually expected this cereal to be very bland, but it turned out so be so good! (guess I shouldn't judge a book by its cover) It has this rich nutty flavor with a touch of cinnamon and spices and a sweetness that isn't too sweet but just right. It's hard not to eat everything in the box in one day, lol.",0
Great cereal. Kids love it.,1
Enjoy this cereal!,1
Although this has a halogen light source it illuminates the vaulted ceilings in our family room just right. It can be very bright when turned all the way or dim as a night light. It does put out some heat and folks should be mindful of that if being placed close to drapes. Bottom line- it is a great light source.,1

"I was disappointed when I received this swag I ordered online and will definitely be returning it. First, the color of the sunflowers is more like a red/orange than yellow. Second, the petals on the sunflowers themselves were all bent. I thought they could easily be bent back in shape, but that isn't the case. I could iron them down, but I won't waste my time. For the price, it's not worth the purchase in my opinion. Sorry, this swag missed the mark for me.",1
"This 'one size fits all' clearly states on the packaging 'youth' - however, not so on line. It was purchased for an adult and now I have to return it and am out shipping costs. If you are looking for a set for a child, its cute - but over age 12 beware.",1
buyer beware--- this item is packaged very poorly! The hat is attached to a piece of cardboard with retail plastic tags which results in very visible holes in the hat. My son is 3 and the vest is to small for him. He usually wears a 5T and the tag on the item says for 3 and older. Def. not worth the money!,1
Bought this for my nephew. Although it isnt the best made costume its fun and he has a blast wearing it,0
Bought this for my nephew. Although it isnt the best made costume its fun and he has a blast wearing it,1
I received an expired product and the oils had separated and it was virtually impossible to eat even after I did try to stir the No Stir product.,0
"both the maple almond butter and the almond coconut butter are stale dated! Received yesterday, going back today.",0
Tasted like warm mayonnaise - contacted MaraNatha to let them know.,0
Received broken glass jar loosely packed in paper inside box. Broken shards of glass throughout.... Luckily I didn't get cut.,1
"I ordered my jar online and it just arrived today. As I was excited to taste it I opened it right away. Upon looking inside, I see the oil completely separated from everything. I know this can happen to nut butters, but this also says NO STIR on the label. I had to completely remove the nut butter from the jar and place it inside a bigger glass bowl and really work the oil back into the very dry nut stuff. Which then made me look at the expiration date, it expires on Sept.15,17 so within 3 months. I do not know how many months out the company puts a label when it is processed. So, maybe that is why it separated the way it did Now, if you don't mind having to re-stir your almond butter back up to the right consistency this stuff does taste REALLY REALLY GOOD!!! I would repurchase it again and hopefully it would have a further out expiration date. I wish i took photos, but I didn't.",0
"Bought this cuz the store was out of Justin's sticking with it cuz the price(I'm not made of money)! Says it's no stir, but mine had half an inch of oil on top and definitely needed to be stirred! May have been an older bottle, cuz I've never bought it before, so once the next one comes in I'll revise my review if necessary. Great flavor over all, love it on an everything bagel.",0
"the first time I bought almond butter it had honey in it. the next time I went into buy some all there was, was maple. to this day I have never seen honey almond butter in any store and I've checked them all. bring back the honey.",1
Good flavor.,1
"I love almond butter, but this takes it to new flavor heights. It's just a little sweet from the maple, It's all about the flavor!",1
"I bought this to use in no-bake lactation cookies. I'd been using peanut butter, but I saw this and it sounded good, plus almonds increase the nutritional content of breastmilk. Oh, my goodness, this stuff is sooooo yummy! Quite a bit more expensive than PB, but much tastier. :)",0
I tried the plain almond butter and didn't like it at all. A friend had this kind and I tasted it and I'm hooked!!,0
"This almond butter is delicious. It's smooth, subtle maple flavor is perfect to stir into warm oatmeal or spread onto Graham crackers.",0
"This is so good, you just want to smack people for not letting you know about it sooner. Put it on apple rice cake and you are gold, my friend. Get busy living or get busy dying.",0
"I was devistated when I went to buy this to refill my supply. Although there were other Maranatha butters on the shelf, no Maple Almond Butter. This is the only one that doesn't contain cane sugar, which I won't consume. Even the plain one has sugar in it. There was no longer a place on the shelf for it either. I'm happy to find I can order it and pick up at the store, just a hassle. I do love the product though.",0
"I spread this on my raisin toast when I need a sweet treat, delicious!",0
Yummy says it all !,0
The Maranatha Almond Butter arrived safely and as expectly. It is so good for a snack and I plan to substitute it for peanut butter (which I also love) in cookies and even candies. Thanks!,1
"I discovered this a few months back, and have become truly addicted to it. On toast, or just directly from the jar into your mouth, it's heavenly!",1
"I am addicted to this stuff! I've tried a few other brands that make a Maple Almond butter, and the Maranatha has the best flavor and texture by far. Try it on Dave's Killer toasted Good Seed bread or slathered on a banana. So good!",1
I couldn't really detect any kind of brownie or even chocolate flavor. Just cloyingly sweet chemical flavor with the added pleasure of looking like you're wearing powdered sugar lipgloss.,1
Net wt was literally half of the claimed weight on outside of bag. i could fold the bag completely in half touching top of bag to bottom. There was no hole or opening in bag so they filled it to this level intentionally.,0
They were pretty good but most of them were smashed. I would recommend buying them at store better.,0
The regular chocolate and PB are way better.,1
Would buy again,1
Great Flavor This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
Very chocolaty taste to them. It hits the sweet tooth. Light snack not heavy eating. It does not taste like a brownie.,0
I love the taste of these they are a wonderful snack to have I don't like to many things either they are two sweet or not sweet enough but these are just perfect I just wish it was easier to find them in stores I have had to buy them online because none of my Walmart stores have them.,1
They actually were pretty good. I would buy again. Very sweet!,0
Has a brownie-like flavor. Tasty. I have a sweet tooth and the Cookies n' Cream was much richer!,1
These are too good!,1
Fun food to eat that's good for you and tastes good. What a great snack.,1
Really good! Good chocolate taste. These are addictive!,1
Love them. Wish they were always available.,1
Try it . You can not stop eating them,1
Is delicious,1
I so love these I eat these at least 3x a week,1
If you love Brownie you love these Chex Mix They are real good I would try these Chex Mix This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
Could not believe how good these were. Went back to store the next day and bought more!,1
Met expectations,1
they have a wonderful melt in your mouth chocolate flavor yet still crunchy,1
They are perfect for that I gotta have a chocolatety bite. Not to sweet but oh so yummy...,1
Very good snack,1
"This chex mix was so delicious! I love a good chocolate snack and this was just what I needed. Just the right amount of everything... Try it, you'll love it!",1
Sinfully delicious!,1
I've always been a fan of Chex Mix snacks and the muddy buddies are tops.,1
Love to take these snacks pool side!,1
These are great!!!!,1
They taste great a wonderful cross of chocolate and crunchy. The powdered suger makes a unique flavor. My only complaint is my local Walmart in Taylor never has them I have go out my way to get them.,1
I remember when these DVDs were so expensive... Now it was so economical I was able to close out that Series in my collection.,1
"Good show, not much into mafia stuff but entertaining",1
Fantastic deal to catch up on everything. Just disappointed with the ending.,1
"We have purchased all of the previous seasons and enjoyed watching them. We knew we would enjoy this season as well! Can't wait to purchase the last season, Season 6 Part II.",1
Great price to close out my Sopranos' DVD collection.,1
a great show with a great cast and the dvd is a great season. a must buy,1
Loved everything about the show and Season Six Part II is no exception!,1
"Season 6 Part 2 of the Sopranos is the amazing conclusion to the greatest television show of all time. Simply put, anything you ever wanted to see from the Sopranos is covered in the final half season, in which every character suffers and triumphs in their own personal way. With David Chase at the helm for the final two part episode as the director, you experience all of the qualities that made the Sopranos such a special series. I promise anyone who has not yet viewed the final episode or heard about it, you will be amazed at the ending. It is truly shocking. You will not regret this purchase, the series is amazing and the final half season is perfection, and if you watch this, it will not disappoint.",1
I watched Season Six of the Sopranos on DVD and the quality looked perfect on my computer screen. I used Microsoft Vista's Home Media Center and it looked great. The mixed the sound just right for a 5.1 speaker system.,1
Great series! This is a must-have.I love the Sopranos. :),1
Nine of the greatest episodes in The Sopranos. Extremely powerful and a great buy for New Jerseyans everywhere,1
"If you love the Godfather Saga or a huge fan of mob movies you will love all six seasons of the Sopranos. This season is the long awaited finale to this mob drama. It is filled with many twits and speculations and of course the biggest question, What happened to Toni?",0
"The best series that cable has ever provided for us. Even though it comes out in all three formats (DVD, HD-DVD, AND Blue Ray); I can't waite to see how it looks on Blue Ray. Something like the Sopranos, you are more intresetedin the quality.",0
Great story line with amazing Blue-Ray quality. Will Recommend!!!,1
"Watched All The Series, Great. Season 6 Was A Little Week, Expected More Action Drama Like The PreVious Seasons. The End Was Open, Lots Of Stories Left Open And Unfinished. The Writers Lost Their Ways And Started StorY Lines You Wanted To See Developed And Give More.",1
GREAT SERIES. HIGHLY RATED . WON MANY EMMYS.VIDEO EXCELLENT QUALITY.YOU HAVE TO GET THE WHOLE SIX SEASON SERIES.,1
This is a great series! Get the entire series. you will enjoy it,1
One of the best series in television history. The Sopranos lives forever on DVD and BluRay. A must-own television series.,1
"Amazing writting, unpredictable ending. Mafia TV show at its best.",1
If you're a fan of Sopranos; Buy this! Great Show!,1
Found a great deal for the final season so I had to get this. Now I have the complete series and can watch it all over again.,1
I found this for a great price and decided to get the last season in a great series. Now I can marathon watch this great show all over again.,1
"My husband and I have seen every episode in the series and yet we continue to watch! As many times as we've seen them we still love the story lines, the acting and everything about the show.",1
"Great TV series, always wanting to know what would happen next in the series so my husband and I started to watch it and could not stop watching until we got to the end.",1
What can you say its the sopranos everything is truly great about this except for the ending. A must own.,1
The end of what must be regarded as one if the very best tv programs ever produced. Not only ground breaking but exceptionally well acted. The characters have a depth rarely seen on tv. This is the pinnacle of great television. It's like watching a great movie every week. Now we can watch over and over.,1
"And here we are after many years and many bodies. How will the story end of Tony and his family? That is question goin in to this season, we get to see Christopher's movie finally made, say goodbye to some long loved characters, and have some good laughs along the way.If you have followed the show up to now, why don't you already have this? Find out why this show has one of the most talked about endings ever",1
Loved the ending... I know a lot of people felt left hanging. But watch it again....they are actually leaving you to decide what might happen as well as the family getting back together and enjoying a family time at a different restaurant....a new beginning I would say. :),1
"The storytelling in the Sopranos just gets better and better. Following the exploits of the notorious mafioso, Anthony Soprano, couldn't be more fun.",1
The Sopranos is a modern classic. If you love stories about the mafia or family relationships you must follow the story of Anthony Soprano.,1
The price was great it was cheaper than any other place that we could find.,1
"I think I said it all already A show that is a classic, too bad it had to end.",1
"What can I say? It's the last chapter of the series without spoiling it for whomever is reading this review. All I can say is that, unlike the rest of the entire series, the writers did a great job keeping you guessing on what was going to happen next, who was going to make it and who was going to ""go fishing"". Gotta get dis one cabeesh?",1
As a Soprano fan I could not pass up the opportunity to complete my dvd series set. The season 6 part 2 set completes the whole story and you will have it before they disappear from the shelves. The longer you wait the higher the price will be and at this price its a steal,1
The Sporanos is one of the best tv series to appear on TV. A must see,1
"Although many didn't like the ending, I think it ended well.",1
This is the best price for this dvd series. These discs are now becoming rare and order only.,1
The last time that I purchased a Sopranos Boxed Set the price point was at $59.99 and I decided to wait until a sell through price point. Bestbuy had it for $19.99 on bluray how much better can you do?...Great quality and great price. Thanks again Bestbuy.,1
Been waiting for the right price for this series. I'm a big Sopranos fan.,1
So glad they are releasing the series in BluRay!!!,1
Great series. Watching it again in BluRay is better!,1
jersey in the building. i would love to recommend this to anybody.,1
the sopranos is one of the best show of al time. and the best quality.,1
Great story line with amazing Blue-Ray quality. Will recommend!!,1
Don't buy this until you've looked at all of the earlier seasons!!!!This is greatest series in television history!,0
"I had BEEN looking everywhere for this, to complete my entire Soprano collection...",1
"Great series, too bad these were the last episodes.",1
One of if not THE greatest cable show from back in the day!,1
This was the last cd I needed to complete the series. What a great final season to a great show!,1
"If you were a fan of the Sopranos, then you need to own the box set. Show was a classic!",1
I love the characterization and writing in this series. Quality series from start to finish!,1
This is an all time great series to watch from start to finish. Classic Sopranos ata great price at Best Buy.,1
Great TV series. Watched it straight though due to I could not stop watching! Always wanting to know what would happen next.,1
So many twists and turns. The story lines consist of situations that the dark side of you wishes you could be involved in. SO GREAT!!,1
"I love the sopranos, this season was great and fun to watch",1
I love the sopranos! This series is one of the greatest series on dvd EVER!,1
Best show in the history of TV. Finally purchased the last season to complete the series. Highly recommend this show to everyone.,1
"If you're getting Sopranos Season 6 part 1, remember to get part to as well. Excellent series.",1
There is not much to say as to why I believe this item is so great... It truly has epitomized all the great intrinsic details that are need to create such a great show and a wonderful actor that will be dearly missed JG>,1
"My son never saw the Sopranos when it was on TV, so he had me buy him all the DVDs. I never watched the show either, so this gives me an opportunity to spend time with my son, and we can enjoy watching all the Soprano DVDs together.",1
Great TV show. Found most of the seasons at a great price!,1
The was a great deal and was finally able to complete my Soprano's collections. Would recommend to anyone.,1
The price was great it was cheaper than any other place we could find.,1
A must see video. The sopranos is the best series ever!,1
Great tv series. Was sad to see the series end. Watched all 6 seasons in 3 weeks.,1
One of the best HBO series of all timeFinal episode should have been different,1
You must buy this!! It is great entertainment. We try to watch an episode every other night.We are addicted to this whole series.,1
"A must have for all sprano's lovers. Watch the whole season in 1 sitting, no need to wait for reruns.",1
"This product is a complete joke it does not do what I says it does and I have be left with the same old dried up hair look and I can't get a brush through it it certainly does not leave it with a glossy, gleaming finish. Do not buy",1
"Bought this conditioner the other day, I usually just get the regular Tresemme conditioner, but I saw this one was a little more expensive, said expert on it and listed other fancy ingredients that I didn't really understand (but who does), and so I figured this was probably a higher quality product. I don't know why, but that was not the case at all for me. Been using it for a few days now, and I'm ready to stop. My hair feels greasy, it's messy, and not at all behaving like it normally does. I honestly used the last remnants of my regular conditioner bottle watered-down so I could get the last bits out of the bottle (we all do that, right) and that worked better than this. Not a fan at all. Very disappointing.",1
I have biracial curly super dry hair and have relied on this conditioner as my go to for my island lifestyle. I'm usually is salt water or chlorine and am in the shower at least twice a day. I only used the original karatin formula to nourish my locks. Which looked amazing after keratin conditioner and avocado oil as a leave in. The new formula is much lighter. My hair is now moisture starved and won't hold a gold curl. It looks matter down. So sad. Not sure why they changed the formula.,1
"My hair was wavy/curly and always frizzy due to humidity. I read the bottles for the Keratin Smooth line and was excited to see that it helped battle frizz. I decided to give it a try. I washed my hair with the shampoo and then used the conditioner, and it is now bone straight. I can't even scrunch it. I am soooo truly upset. Will my hair ever curl again I've washed it twice since using the Keratin Smooth stuff. I only used the stuff ONE TIME! And, it did NOT help with my frizz either. Right now, I'm living in a nightmare. I want my curls back!!! I definitely would not recommend this line to anyone.",1
"I changed my Shampoo to Tresemme Keratin shampoo and its conditioner but only to realise it was a real bad idea. My hair has never felt any worse. I have curly hair and after using this product, the feeling is like straw. Believing what you promise on your TV commercial, I bought the largest bottle and OMG What a Waste!!!!!! My hair gives a very oily feel soon after I wash my hair.... Sorry Guys!!!!! I would definately NEVER reccommend this product...... ITS REAL BAD!!!!",1
This shampoo/conditioner is great the first day.....not so great the next day. I have very normal hair and can go a day or two without washing. Not with this product. I'm very disappointed as this was more expensive than the regular product.,1
"I have had dry frizzy hair for 30 years and tried many products that have failed. Before I tried this, I was using Tresemme's Smooth Silky sham/cond plus applying 3x the recommended amount of a leave in salon super skinny serum. It was the best I could find, but on some days it just frizzed and looked bad. Then I tried this product and was immediately impressed with performance. My hair was smooth and soft and very manageable. I finally have the soft, healthy looking straight hair I have always wnted. When I put my hair into a ponytail it looks a lot smoother than before. The odor of this product is difficult to deal with the first few days. It smells like cheap hairspray or cheap cologne trying to cover up an even worse smell.. The first time I used it my teenage daughter asked me to crack the window of the car so she didn't have to smell it. But over time we got used to it. I shampoo almost daily and I am now on my 4th bottle of each, shampoo and conditioner, and have consistently had great results. (I still use the super skinny serum).",0
"I have thick hair, and I do like the conditioner, but I need one that will control frizzy hair all day long. It works better than most conditioners I've tried, but I still have fly-away hair. I will continue to look for a conditioner that keeps the fly-away hair smooth all day long.",1
It makes my nearly unmanageable hair smooth and soft.,1
love it,1
good,0
My curls were always crazy and all over the place with frizz... when it was humid out my hair would grow but not in a good way. It would grow up and out! Since using this new product my hair has not done that as much. I have to say I am very pleased with my hair. It smells nice and is soft and manageable. I do not have to spend 20-30 minutes trying to 'tame' my hair any more or just pull it back into a pony tail...it already looks good thanks to TRESemme's Keratin Shampoo and Conditioning line.,1
"I've used this product for a few months and I love it! Though I still do have very frizzy hair. It helps keep my hair smooth, which I love. I only use the conditioner, and not the shampoo so that may be the problem with the frizz. I'm so happy with Tresemme that I'm thinking of purchasing their serum. Hopefully using the conditioner + serum will help with the frizz. I recommend this product to people with unmanageable hair, and to people who straighten their hair.",1
I bought this condition because I wanted my dry hair to feel soft. This conditioner did exactly that. I also use the shampoo with it. Leave the condition in your hair for at least 3 minutes and then wash with cool water after shampooing..You will see great results :) these products also smell fantastic and make your hair smell fantastic,1
The product is great but it leaked during shipping so it was a mess in the bag that also contained the shampoo that did not leak,1
"I have been religiously using this product for a couple of months to really be able to give it a fair and honest review and I can happily say that it has definitely made a huge difference in the texture, strength, and overall appearance of my hair. I had dry and damaged locks due to neglect and this has made my hair manageable and less frizzy every time I use it. In combination with the whole line I have seen drastic changes and will continue using this product in the future.",1
"I absolutely loved the way the conditioner made my hair feel. It was so soft, and silky and had some life to it for the first time in a long time. And it smelled amazing too! I got lots of compliments about it and everyone was asking so of course I shared my secret! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I am 46 years old and I have always had dry, coarse, frizzy hair UNTIL today (: I used the Tresemme Keratin Smooth Conditioner along with another brand of shampoo that I wasn't very impressed with but I was trying to use it up before I began using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo. I washed my hair and applied the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Conditioner. I could tell as soon as I had this conditioner in my hands that it was different from anything else I have EVER tried in the past which includes other brands of Keratin shampoos, conditioners treatments. I've tried Wen, Biolage - everything and nothing has come close to this product. I don't what's in this stuff but I love it! It's extremely rich, emollient and it felt VERY SILKY. I have Lupus and I wasn't feeling well so I skipped the leave in products that I normally have to cover my hair with to control the frizz and get a little softness. I fell asleep with my hair still damp. When I awoke I could not believe it was MY hair on my head! I was stunned at how soft, silky and healthy looking this conditioner left MY hair. I kept saying to my self ''this can't be MY hair!. I never have soft hair, NEVER! I am so excited that I've decided to toss the rest of my old shampoo out so that I can begin using the Tresseme Keratin Smooth Shampoo along with the conditioner. I will purchase this stuff as long as I can get my hands on it!!",0
I love this collection of products. They work fantastically together and I love the way they make my hair feel! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"1. This product was AMAZING in detangling! I have very thick and curly hair so detangling can be a hassle. Now when I read it on the bottle that it helps with detangling, I wasn't really expecting it to work on my hair type. But it litterAly produced miracles. It has a good slip to it, I did notice that it's best when the hair is wet. When it's wet I didn't have to use much of the product to get it to detangle. 2. I decided to leave it in as a deep conditioner for about and hour, so it can feel condition my hair. When I rinsed it out my hair was litterAly the softest I've ever felt it, ( given I had just risned it out and it had no product in it at all). The conditioner made my hair feel clean and mosturied. And just healthy. Idk it's like you know when something is just right for your hair and this was it for me. 3. I didn't have any problem with my scalp as mentioned in the other reviews. But I've never had that problem with any products. 4. On the bottle it mention friz control, I didn't see a huge difference in that buuut considering my hair type I didn't expect to. 5. The smell is heavenly lol I just like that it smell light and not like you have a load of hair products in ur hair. It just has a nice simple smell. I mean I like it.",1
"I have thick, coarse naturally curly hair that tends to frizz. This Conditioner along with the TRESemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Shampoo, makes my hair very soft manageable.",0
It was awesome. Really loved the way may hair felt after using the product!,1
"I recently bought this product specifically because it's main ingredient is keratin, a protein great for reducing frizz, smoothing hair, and strengthening hair. I have natural, 4b hair type meaning my hair is extremely frizzy, tightly coiled, and somewhat coarse. After washing my hair with TRESemme Split End Remedy Shampoo, I deep conditioned with this conditioner by applying it on my hair, then covered my hair with a shower cap for 20 minutes. Upon rinsing, my hair was more manageable and less frizzy. Afterwards, I styled my hair in bantu knots. A day later, I unraveled my hair, and discovered Tresemme Keratin Smooth Keratin Infusing Conditioner, 25 Ounce actually stretched my hair similar to a hair straightener or a Brazilian keratin treatment. I will definitely purchase this conditioner again. Quite frankly, it does more to manage my hair than high-end lines.",1
This conditioner works perfectly to smooth and moisturize my hair.,1
My hairstylist recommended this as a shampoo I could use to preserve my hair color and not pay a fortune. Love the silk feeling and smell it leaves. Just like I left the salon!,0
I love this conditioner. It leaves my hair so silky and smooth! It is my favorite. I don't know what I would do if they stopped making it!,0
"Most that give negative reviews fail to mention personal hair texture and scalp sensitivity. 1) keratin treatment isn't for everyday usage. If you use it everyday or every other day it may make your hair brittle (which will cause breakage). Try to wash and condition your hair no earlier than 6 weeks from initial usages (this goes for any keratin or kertain infused treatment is based off your own hair texture). 2) if you have sensitive scalp consult with a professional, they may recommend a different brand. However, a sensitive scalp may get away with using the conditioner only. Keep in mind that a keratin treatment is for straighten and/or loosening curls excessive usage is the same as over processing hair with dye, relaxers, perms, etc. Keep another shampoo and conditioner handy for your normal routine.",1
"I have frizzy wavy hair with lots of fly aways. This product makes my hair less frizzy, smooth, and shiny. Will definitely buy again. I use the shampoo and conditioner about once a week(my hair never gets oily)",1
"This conditioner is by far the best I have ever had. I do not personally use the whole collection so it is hard to get the results that commercials claim you will get. This is the first time using any Tresemme product where I feel I get those claims only using the one product. I shampoo and condition my hair, I do not use any other styling products. After using this conditioner the very first time I had no frizz at all. I blew dry my hair and didn't even have to use a straightener. I even woke up the next morning, threw it in a bun without washing it, let it out after I got out of the shower and it was perfect...no frizz, no flyaways...nothing. It is super smooth and looks like I just left the salon everyday no matter what I do with it!",1
This conditioner is amazing for my curls. It really helps livin them up,1
"I love how smooth my hair feels after rinsing, and combing my thick hair is a breeze!",1
This is the best kind of shampoo and conditioner that I have ever used. It gets my hair very soft and doesn't have any static electricity in it when I straighten it.,1
"This conditioner makes my hair very smooth and managable, and is a bargain to boot.",1
"I just bought this product and have been using it for the past week or so, and my hair has never looked better! I have naturally very straight thin hair, that is very weak and falls out easily gets knotted very easily. I have previously read/heard keratin helps strengthen hair so when I saw this I knew I had to try it out. It did wonders for my hair! Not only does my hair feel stronger, shinier more easy to manage, but any flyaways on top of my head are smoothed out my hair quite frankly looks healthy witha lot more volume than usual. Also, I dont even use it with the shampoo it was all in the work of the conditioner.",1
This line does what it says. Keeps my hair frizz free for 48 hours. Smells good too.,0

"I originally started my regimen with the TRESemme' 7 Day Keratin Smooth System.It really left my hair soft, strong and more manageable with each use. Once I completed the 7 day regimen, I started the Smooth Keratin Infusion Shampoo Conditioner. I co-wash with the conditioner every other day and shampoo every two weeks. I always get compliments on my 4b/4c curls and their definition since using the TRESemme' Keratin Smooth line. Thanks TRESemme'",1
"I have been dealing with frizz now for almost 7 years now, when I In was pregnant with my 4th child my hsir turned frizzy, course and curly. Nothing has worked for more than an hour to kep frizz down. I used the 3 step treatment and to my surprise this worked! It stayed smooth, soft and straight all day. I will definitely keep using this product. I honestly didnt think a product this inexpensive could kep frizz at bay, but I am now a believer!",1
I have used both the shampoo and conditioner for 6 months now and just love them! My hair was starting to feel very dry so I tried these and they worked great! My hair is very shiny and blowdries so smooth. My hair used to air-dry wavy and after months of use my hair is straight now which I like.,1
"This is awesome conditioner. Not only does it smell great, it takes all tangles out. No more split ends and fly always. Just like I've had a beauty shop treatment. My granddaughter who's a beautician recommened it to me.",1
I have been growing my hair out for about a year and a half now and this product is marvelous. A lot of girls with super long hair have really bad tips but with this product it has helped me keep my tips in good condition. Also this product helps my hair grow out evenly so it doesn't start getting thinner towards the tips.,1
This product totally eliminated my frizz. I purchased this product 2 days ago and tried it the other night. I was doubtful this product would work because my hair is so thick and frizzy but it exceeded my expectations and after straightening my hair the product worked wonderfully! I got so many complements!!,1
The TRESemme Keratin conditioner is very nice for straight hair. I recommend this for those who have straight hair. My hair is curly so it still is good but doesn't do exactly what my hair needs for the waves and curls. Good Product however.,1
I wish that I knew about this product earlier because not only is it a great product but it smells really good also including the shampoo. It's a magical experience.,1
"I have extremely dry, brittle hair. This is the only conditioner that makes my hair smooth and tangle free after I use it. It doesn't build up like other conditioners and makes my hair feel strong again!",1
Makes my hair soft and silky,1
"It was good i brought the conditioner and the shampoo and they was good , ididnt notice a different from the first time , i have been using them for a month ...my hari now feels much better than before",1
I recently had a lot of coloring done to my hair and it baca me rather frizzy. Other conditioners left it feeling dry. A friend of mine mentioned this conditioner so I bought it and WOW....I love it!,1
"After one use I noticed a difference in the softness of my hair, my friends noticed it too. I currently have pretty bad ends and could really use a trim and my co-worked stated that my ends look alot better. Would recommend to anybody.",1
"I am African American with 4c hair and this is the best conditioner I have ever used on my hair. My hair is soft, silky, smooth and moisturized. I highly recommend it. 10 stars!",1
Does work well,1
"Not a thing, I love the product, will buy agin",1
"This product is amazing! After my shower, my hair was instantly smooth! The boys will chase me!",1
This product makes my hair so shiny and manageable.,1
"this product has turned my hair from a horrible piece of dead ends into a glamorous, straight masterpeice.",1
"I really enjoyed this. The smell is very fresh, like very clean victorian roses.",1
Love it did what the bottle says it would do!,1
I would have loved it if it would have stayed plugged in and on.,0
"The house, took it out a week later and plugged it in- DEAD WOuld not power up at all in all 3 cars. Returning it today.",0
"okey dokey, worked the first time I tried it for re-charging phone, have not tried the ac outlet as yet but I am sure it will be okay, they were out of stock at the store, (crabtree mall, Raleigh) so I ordered on line 10 days till I received it.",1
I use this in an industrial setting and it works great. I would recommend this product to anybody that needs an item like this.,0
"Why doesn't everyone have one for their car? I don't want to buy a car charger adapter each time, I just want to plug my electrics into my car. Now I can :)",0
"Everything isn't for everyone. Before you use this product, know your hair type as well as the state of your hair. I have transitioning 4b hair and this product caused massive tangles and knots in my hair, so much so that I had to cut them out! As a result, I'm left with uneven hair all over my head. Furthermore it left my natural hair dry and much of my normal wave pattern is gone. I can tell I'm in for a long road in trying to repair the damage its caused.",0
"I decided to try this conditioner thinking it would rejuvenate my curls but it did the exact opposite. This product made my hair feel like straw! It had that squeaky feeling after, you know the one you get when you use sulfate shampoos... It really didnt do anything. SMH",0
Made our hair feel dry and rough,0
I decided to go old school with my hair and get back to Cream of Nature. I purchased this conditioner thinking it would be better than just regular conditioner. It's okay but I don't think my hair likes it. It is super thick and I think I need to use the regular Cream of Nature. I need the conditioner to be more creamy and water soluble.,1
I normally use SheaMoisture but decided to give this product a try and I'm so happy that I did. I am completely natural with very thick 4a type hair and my hair LOVE this product. It is very thick and creamy leaving my curls extremely soft and full shine.,0
"To begin this review, I will begin to describe a little about myself. I am an African American female who is relaxer free. My hair is afro textured and it is naturally dry. I usually use Aussie moist as my deep conditioner but I wanted to try something new. I purchased this item in the little packet size first because the bottle is a bit out of my comfort zone far as price and I didn't want to get stuck with a pricey bottle of conditioner that I didn't even like go through the whole process of returning it that's if I could, etc you get the point. I washed my hair as usual with my own shampoo, and then placed the Cream of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning Treatment on my hair and covered it with a plastic cap for about 30 minutes. When I tell you the results were amazing! Believe me! My hair was so moisturized and it looked as if I had already moisturized my hair with an oil.",0
Very good product. Doesn't strip color,0
Leaves my natural curls soft and manageable.,0
"I love Cream of Nature Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning. My daughter has think, curly, wavy hair that tangles up after shampooing and Argan Oil Intensive Conditioning helps me comb out her hair and makes it manageable and easy to style.",0
Decided to go sulfate free and I am glad I did. This is awesome conditioning treatment! Will be buying more!,0
Would Recommend To Family And Friends,1
Love product and it is very good for my hair,0
"I have been using Arrid for decades...it was the only product that kept me dry. I liked it so much so, that I started ordering it by the case (less expensive that way too). About two months ago, I used the last can from the case. I picked up a can at my local grocery and thought I was good to go. Not so. I was surprised that I felt wetness an hour after I used the new can. I thought it might have been a 'bad' batch that had worked its way to my market. So, I went to a different store and bought another can....same thing happened. Evidently, the formula was changed or something...the last spray from the can from my case worked fine. The new purchases didn't. So, I don't think it's my body chemistry that has changed. I think it is Arrid. I am now searching for a better product or one that works. Too bad, Arrid. You've lost a loyal customer.",1
"i aways bought the xxx but can not find it so i used the xx Terrible, does not work. Been using the xxx for 40 years, what happened",1
"I ordered three of this item, This is the only deodorant product we use. Would have ben 5 star but we only got two as ordered and one of another arid product. Not worth time and effort to return, but at two for the price of three wipes out the savings I expected when ordering from Walmart",0
the scent was too perfumey - husband did not like it,1
"This deodorant does work well it keeps your under arms very dry, and that says a lot when you live in the south during the summer.",1
I Know it's not good for the ozone but it's the only anti-persperant that works for me,1
The only thing we ever use. EFFECTIVE.,1
"No matter how many other deodorants I try I always go back to Arrid I love it so much and will always us it, it doesn't cake up or leave stains on my clothing",0
"I've used this for years and wouldn't change. I recommended it to a friend that couldn't find something that helped her with sweat and odor. She bought it, it worked, she loved it. I don't understand why this isn't the most popular spray out there. Even better than Arrid Blue can.",0
This product works for me. I stay dry all day. I like the smell of it too.,1
I am over 70 y/o and have used only this deodorant (no other brand will do) for over 50 years. Can't live without and will not substitute,1
"Only formula that works for my body chemistry, Has been taken off local store shelves",1
"I have been using this item for years but in the last 2 years it has become more and more difficult to purchase at my local stores. I have tried Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Albertsons and the Dollar General Stores. I have to buy in quantities of 4 or 6 so that I don't run out.",1
I have been using arrid for many years and no ther deodorant can compare. It lasts all day long and is not overpowering. The value is great as well. I have tried other brands but arrid is the best I can find.,1
Best deodorant I've found!,1
I've bought this in the past and was glad I did.loved the nice fresh scent.,1
I have used many deodorants and nothing seems to keep me dry smelling good lasting longer as Arrid Anti-Perspirant. I would recommend this product to everyone.,1
It's works great loveit,1
"I'm would recommend this Eagle Brand Borden Sweetened Condensed Milk Fat Free, as a good substitute to the original, but the original tastes better, in my opinion. Thanks for reading!",0
We love using eagle brands for our fruit salads,1
"Love the fat free when it delivers rich, creamy taste. I've used this product before--also the Eagle Brand regular. The price was also great. And LOVE the free ship!!!",1
"Love the fat free when it delivers rich, creamy taste. I've used this product before--also the Eagle Brand regular. The price was also great. And LOVE the free ship!!!",1
"Fat or no-fat, it's difficult to find anything bad about Eagle Brand! This purchase is an excellent bargain as it almost always is pricier in stores (more so than the regular Eagle Brand). Especially in the summer we love homemade shakes made with Eagle Brand Fat-Free Sweetened Condensed Milk, Fat-Free Evaported milk, fruit, ice and Sweet 'n' Low, so we use a LOT of it. It makes wonderful lemon icebox pies without worrying about all those fat calories in the filling, makes a great hot fudge sauce and many other items. It lacks a bit of the fullness of the regular Eagle Brand if tasted directly from the can, but when used in recipes it's almost impossible to tell the difference.",0
"Great item, wonderful flavor, no different than original eagle brand!",0
This can be used in so many recipes. Lots of dessert options.,0
Yummy,0
Makes the best taste you could ever want,1
Its great,0
Great,1
Yes it work great for fudge recipe on the can every christmas I make it,1
As good as regular.,1
"You cannot tell this is fat free, I swear! I use it primarily in my key lime pie (with reduced fat Graham crust and Lite Coolwhip). Give it a try!",1
"best product ever, always good and advertised",1
i just love what the green gel does for holding my hair in place. My hair stays put even on a windy day !,1
Product is great thank you,1
"Clubman Styling Gel works very well and holds hair firmly,works GREAT....",1
This is the best hair gel I have used. I especially like that it is clear and leaves no trace of color like so many other gels often do.,1
GREAT!,1
firm hold without dandruff,1
I loved this at my wedding! I put the little cards in a fabric picture holder and let guests write on them at their leisure during the reception. I also passed them out at my rehearsal diner! I will cherish the wishes written on there forever! This was a great addition to my wedding!,0
I read the ingredients and did not find any ginger ale in the ingredients. Why is this product not been invested for deceptive marketing practices. I will not buy the product any more.,1
Tried for first time and not too bad of a taste considering its diet,1
"I started drinking Canada Dry ginger ale from watching the TV show Everybody Loves Raymond. Now I'm on the diet version. The taste is pretty much the same, that's the good thing. But there is a large dose of sodium in every can: 120mg of sodium per 12 fl oz can. That's 3 times as much as Coke Zero, which is 40mg per 12 fl oz. I have to knock a star off because of this. If Canada Dry can drop the sodium down to Coke Zero level, that would make it perfect!",1
"I love the diet ginger ale and have been buying it for many years. Recently, the 2 liter bottle has some kind of defect in it. The bottom center of the bottle is longer than the bottom sides of the bottle, forcing the bottle to teeter and lean to all sides, eventually leading to a tip over. Needless to say, I will NO longer buy this size bottle and I will look for a replacement brand to take it's place. And no, I do not want to buy other size bottles as the 2 liter is the best value for the money. CHANGE YOUR BOTTLE!",1

I enjoy a Diet Ginger Ale on occasion. I was reading the label and noticed that my bottle says Made with Real Ginger. There is nothing in the list of ingredients that says Ginger. I like the product but think the label is misleading.,1

There's never enough of the soda on the shelf it seems that when I go to purchase it there always are down to one or two cases. It doesn't have a bad aftertaste considering that it's diet.,1
I love the refreshing taste. Don't really like to drink dark diet sodas,1
I have drunk it plenty times and l would say its fab..,1
This is the only kind of diet soda I've found that doesn't have the aftertaste that ruins so many other diet drinks. I love Canada Dry Diet Ginger Ale.,0
I really wish I could find your diet Ginger Ale's in bulk. I admit I drink a lot of it but it's so refreshing and relaxing.,1
I love Canada Dry Diet Ginger ale not only is it refreshing and thirst quenching but a great mixer.,1
"I live closer to the Texarkana, Arkansas WalMart, but as this is my favorite soft drink I drive out of my way each week so that I can have my Diet Ginger Ale to the Texarkana, Texas location! Yes , I love my Canada Dry!",1
Mary Desilets Canada Dry is the ONLY Ginger Ale! Growing up as a kid I remember when I was sick with a cold and sore throat A Canada Dry Ginger Ale with some vanilla ice cream Always made me feel better...STILL DOES! I had 2 vanilla ginger ale sodas today. Right now sitting here with a small glass of Canada Dry Ginger Ale! mmm mmm good!,1
"I first bought this, to ease the thirst for the flu. But I have continued to drink it to quench my thirst and to refresh me----like a shower in a can. Finished with the dark drinks.....this just does the job",1
Canada Dry Diet Ginger Ale is the very best. My favorite diet soda.,1
It's light and refreshing-takes away my craving for sweets.,1
I have been drinking Canada Dry because it has Real Gingerin it. It is such a soothing drink when I need something to perk me up..the little fizzes makes me think of sizzles when meat is cooking...,1
"At the age of 65 I tried my first Canada Dry Ginger Ale on vacation can you imagine Since that vacation I am hooked tried the diet Ale my husband is diabetic just as tasty as the regular love, love, love it we can't find the Holiday Ale we so wanted to try it!!",1
"I love Diet Canada Dry Ginger Ale and drink it daily. I love the taste, the fizzinessm quenches my thirst.",1
"We only drink diet drinks that have no suger and no caffiene, and this fits the bill plus it tastes good too.",1
Diet Canada Dry has been a staple in my household for at least a year. I am diabetic and I've tried Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi. The didn't work. So I decided to try Diet Canada Dry. So GLAD I did.,1
Rarely drink any carbonated drinks and I have to watch my sugar intake. Love this Diet Ginger Ale. Always keep it on hand and all I drink if I get an upset stomach.,1
I drink this all the time. I love the ginger ale products,1
I find it very refreshing. It is crisper than other brands. I moan and shake my head when my wife brings home another brand. This summer I started drinking it with garden grown jalapenos in it. What a SNAP! I also love the cranberry diet ginger ale during the holidays.,1
i have become hooked on this...it is an awesome drink thanks for making it,1
I'm a diabetic and this best drink on the market. No aftertaste!,1
This is my son's drink of choice! The only problem we have here in Villa Rica GA is finding the diet ginger ale. Our retailers just don't stock enough of the diet ginger ale!!,1
"I brought this 122016. Taste so good tha if you pour it in a glass and gave it to someone, I bet that they could not tell that it was diet soda.",1
I use this with a squeeze of lemon great taste no suger yea,1
"My Husband had a Heartattack in 2012 and this is what they put him on, now this is all we drink, no caffeine and great taste, love it",1
I love the crisp refreshing taste knowing it's calorie free!,1
It was very cool refreshing after being chilled.,1
This is a terrific drink on it's own.but when you have a bad stomach or upset stomach this is the drink to go to . this drink is not only refreshing but also soothing to your stomach Thanks,1
Though I have to purchase shower now it's an awesome product! Mom used to give us some when we would have an upset stomach. Maybe it was just moms love that made us better but as an adult I still think it has these healing properties! Or just a comfort from days gone by!,1
Does not have a bad taste like other diet drinks do.,1
Great taste and great mixer,1
"Always like this drink, it's light and refreshing.",1
Good taste,1
I us this as a mixer. The price was great as well.,1
I love this product but I have a hard time finding it in some of your stores so I go to Publix because they have a variety of flavors of this product!!!,1
Great soda,1
"Baxter's Cream Pomade claims to be a light hold/soft finish product. It really doesn't feel like a pomade at all. To me, it's just a thick cream that probably could have been put in a squeeze tube.For me, I find the best way to use hair products is to layer them. So I would 1) work in this soft creme, or a comparable workable pomade 2) add a thickening agent like a hard creme and 3) finish with something that gives a firm hold.Also, not a huge believer in the less is more rule when it comes to hair products. I prefer a good finger full evenly worked throughout. Same for this product. I mean I don't goop it on, but using a dime-size isn't enough.Since all hair is different and the styles desired by people too, hair products can be very subjective in how they are rated. That caveat aside, if your hair is short and you do use product, then I'd bet this soft cream could find a home in your hair product selection. It will put your hair into a workable, flexible mode that is ready for shaping in any way you want. I wouldn't use it on it's own because the hold factor isn't there for the style I wear. It just makes the hair maneuverable enough to style the way I want, and then I use something else to lock that style in place. If you were going for a natural comb to one side look, this might be all you need thought. As a closing note, the glass jar this stuff comes in is really cool. Price is a bit high, but it is good stuff.I would use the product again.",1
"Was never a fan of pomade--never really knew how to make it work and still look good on me. I read about this product in an on-line article and thought what the heck, try it. It has not been a bad product. I like it better than other pomades I have purchased in the past from salons.",1
"Baxter's Cream Pomade is a nice, clean hair product that incorporates well on your strands and keeps things looking soft and natural through the course of a day. I have short-medium mens hair and I prefer to keep my style looking clean-cut, masculine and unfussy and this product manages to keep things in line by providing some added volume and a subtle, moisturized finish.The compact 2 ounce jar is handy when traveling and since a small dab is all I need I expect it to last at least 3 months with near daily use. The cream gets kudos for those who like to keep things low maintenance as it easily applies to your hair, washes out with no hassle and has no perfumed scent worth mention.",1
"I started growing out my hair a couple months ago. BoC Clay Pomade used to be my go-to product, but it was making my hair a bit too stiff as it got longer. I tried this cream as a substitute, and it's just what I needed.",1
"Switched from Malin + Goetz's styling cream. This has more hold, and doesn't leave much residue. Keeps my hair in it's styled position, and leaves it soft. If you want a solid product that has a firm hold, but doesn't leave your hair all sticky and gross, this is the one you need. I couldn't recommend it highly enough.",1
"I've tried many products to control my hair and many are just terrible... either too greasy, too shiny, too thick or too much fragrance or some combination of these. I had the opportunity to try this Baxter of California Cream Pomade and this may be one hair product that I'll actually use again.It's a very lightweight cream with a consistency similar to a hand cream. Previously I had been using MenScience Hair Styling Pomade (2 oz.) and it is very hard in the container... nearly like hardened wax. It's somewhat of a chore to use it because you literally have to scoop out a dab of it and let it warm up in your hands before you can put it into your hair.This pomade is very creamy and infinitely easier to scoop out and apply than the MenScience Pomade. Although the Baxter of California Pomade is not fragrance free, the amount of fragrance is very minimal and barely discernible.It's a lightweight holding power that lets my curls curl and at the same time leaves my hair soft. It may not provide enough hold for some hair types but for my hair, it works great.",0
"I have been using this for a month now and I love it! I have short fly away hair and this pomade has just enough hold to keep my aid in place during the day without making my hair look greasy or like it has a lot of product in it. The smell is also wonderful! My wife, who also has short hair, has been using it as well and she loves it and how the smell is there, but not overpowering like many of the products out there.This is a great pomade and wonderful for some light hold styling!",1
"great product. i've tried a few other pomades, but prefer Baxter cream pomade as my go-to everyday one. I find it gives off a more natural look (not the pomade to get if you want a slickback) and a natural hold.For a greasy look, i usually use Anchors Teddy Boy original.",1
My family didn't not like the flavor.,1
"Tastes way to processed and after taste is horrible, will start making my own.",1
"It's not bad, but could be a little more garlicky.",0
Creamy and tasty.,0
"pretty good in a pinch, usually make my own, but will probably use it again",0
Good for casarole,1
"This stuff is AWESOME! It has just a hint of garlic, enough to make it delicious and not over whelming. I served it over bow tie pasta, mixed vegetables and cut-up chicken with just a sprinkle of black pepper and it was FANTASTIC! It is my new addiction!",0
I use this product all the time. We love to have Alfredo and this particular Ragu taste the best! I saut onions and add canned shredded chicken and sliced up romen tomatoes. Then add the Ragu and noodles. Yummy!!!!,0
If you want a sauce with just enough garlic to crash your craving it's in there! We love it!,0
"This brand is so far the that I have had, and now all I use is ragu.",0
Wonderful,0
Ragu is way better than an generic kind.,0
Awesome flavor,0
"I love the taste of this sauce, it's almost like homemade.",0
The sauce was very creamy and tasted fresh and not something you would get out of a jar.,0
great product very tasty,0
The kids like this sauce.,0
"I love this sauce! My favorite way to use it is over cheese tortellini for a quick, tasty dish.",0
Tastes so good!!!!,0
"Ragu makes good products, and this one was especially tasty!!",1
Love this sauce use it all the time for shrimp fettuccine,1
Use this specific Ragu Sauce for my Seafood shrimp pasta it was amazing,1
It is too loud. One of them did not work. Otherwise it's good.,1
They don't stay stuck on the area above the doors it only remained in place on the sliding glass door.,0
this is a very cheap option if you need just a minimum security,0
"This window/door alarm is effective and easy to use. The chime and alarm features are both appropriately loud and will immediately gain one's attention. Installation is easy IF your door is flush with its surrounding framing. If not, you will need to figure out a way to make the alarm and the sensor even with each other. Overall, this is a good, inexpensive alarm.",0
This alarm is great for its price. It would be better if you can adjust the volume of the chime. Its very loud. Very easy to install. I have already recommended it to some friends.,0
Love the siren its too loud. I feel more safer now,1
Great Security Alarms for windows very loud!!!!!!!,0
Pretty basic alerting system. Good price for what you get.,0
It was loud enough to scare my 5 year old. Easy to install and directions were easy to follow.,0
"Fantastic product for the price....keeps you alert to all doors - windows connected to with either a chime or alarm. Priced right, undoubtedly, however. One downfall is that once the door or window is closed the alarm stops due to the reconnection, thus. This is NOT an alarm for those away from home, it's main benefit is while you are at home. Either way, for the cost it is a value and permits us to sleep better!",0
"My review is based on apartment living. Not sure how the sound may carry in bigger homes, however in a small single family home I think the sound will still travel loudly. I received this as a house warming gift from my registry about 2 years ago. I had 2 purposes in mind when I listed them, safety to alert me if my then 4 year old tried to open the doors (I strongly recommend for single parents if you don't have a second pair of eyes to keep on your young child while showering or even if just in a back room), and security because we are living in a ground floor apartment. It has a chime ring or the option for loud squelching. I keep it on the loud squelching. It is so loud, there is no way that anyone inside of the home can't hear it. It's been two years and I have not had to change the batteries yet. The picture being used for the advertisement is about how far they can separate from each other before the alarm is triggered. Just very recently, we experienced a scare where someone had picked my patio lock and tried to enter our home. This definitely scared them away once the alarm was triggered.",0
Alarms work great and are loud enough to be heard.,0
"Excellent product, especially for the price. It has three modes: Chime, Alarm, & Off. It is fantastic for when you are home as this alarm on any mode turns quite as soon as the door or window makes contact/closed again. It will not alert you from a distance, however. You can ask your neighbors if heard to check on your place. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to sleep well!",0
Too hard to put items in - kept jamming fingers on the inner file divisions. Maybe good if only going to have a few pieces of info in a file - like a monthly/customer file. Most of my filing involves a lot of papers - this doesn't work for that.,1
"I purchased this product for my business use. Although the concept was good, the construction was marginal and the quality of the materials was poor. This is unusual for Pendaflex product as they are known for quality products",1
Limited uses. Product is not good if using multiple full size sheets of paper. Would be good for receipts and things like that. Good that small things won't fall through the bottom of the folder. Folder sections don't expand with the rest of the file folder for thicker files. The major flaw is how thin the file folder is. I use file folders to protect other papers - I want something that will hold up to a lot of handling and tossing on the car seat or on the desk. I don't want something that looks and feels like paper - I want something stronger.,1
Very flimsy - tears easily not intended for long term usage.,1
"I had intended to utilize this folders for project organization, but the construction is flimsy and they did not hold up. Two suggestions for future revisions of this product: 1) use a heavier weight material and 2)the bottom two sections should be closed from both sides.",1
The only thing I would change about this product would be to have made it available in a variety of colors.,1
I thought this would be a great idea for my real estate business. The pockets dont hold alot but the worst part is the main subjext tab is getting ripped and bent. Dont seem to be as strong as my regular folders. Better use for personal filing of home bills or other organizing.,1
"A practical idea, beneficial for occasional projects. Usability though is severely hampered by ridiculously thin stock, making this far too flimsy for actual use beyond file and forget. As an active organizer for ongoing tasks, which the form factor seems to be targeting, it falls pathetically short due to the flimsiness of material as repeated handling is near impossible. Good idea, execrable execution.",1
"I am excited to use this product, BUT the package of 12 was actually only 11. When I'm creating monthly files, missing one is kind of a big deal.",1
This file wouldn't hold enough for the projects I handle.,1
"Great idea, but this product needs to be sturdier to stand up to the repeated use I give my folders. The paper is too flimsy. I would definitely use it if the paper quality was upgraded.",1
"If paper used was heavier, it would be a great item. However current paper is not heavy enough...if used constantly, not sure how long it would last.",1
"I use this product to organize my business files. I like that I am able to separate my documents in sections. However, it is limited. It would be practical is the left side opened instead. The product is flimsy and does not seem as durable as I expected.",1
Would rather have a product that was made out of heavier paper stock.,1
I use it to organize high level visits to my building with many lists and subsections needed. Unfortunately it does not hold up well. Could be made of a stronger (thicker) stock.,1
This product is a great idea but is not well implemented. The internal partitions are not well thought. The partial divider is really odd and serve to separate sheets but with limited ability to keep things from falling out.,1
"The concept is great, but this product needs to be sturdier.",1
This product allows me to keep pending items and items waiting for additional info with my everyday projects allowing visability yet out of the way.,1
Great for grouping things that wouldn't need a complete file of their own. The last divider doesn't go all the way to the bottom small items could jumble together.,1
Currently using to organize my monthly bills and statements.,1
Liked concept. Folder seems flimsy. File tab needs another .25 for full label view.,1
"Perhaps providing this same design with plastic folders could work. The folders work best with just one or two documents in each flap. I do like the idea, but as a classroom teacher, I need durability.",1
I bought this product because it looked like an interesting way to keep track of our paper work as it pertains to each project. So far it has done that.,1
"I recently received a few of these folders to try. This is a great product, but the construction is very flimsy. I would like to see this product available in a sturdier material or even a lightweight plastic so it could be used more than once. I plan to use these to organize my boss' travel including itinerary, flights, hotel, car and he can use the small pocket to drop in his receipts before he hands it all back to me for processing.",1
1/2 THE TABS ARE FACING ONE WAY AND 1/2 THE OTHER (PREFER THEM TO ALL FACE THE SAME WAY),1
I take this for while I am on the road as it compresses my papers. It takes up less space in my bag through I do worry it would rip if I pull out the folders the wrong way.,1
I purchased these folders for work but found that the folders tore easily and were flimsy. I am not confident that the materials will remain in the folder. It would be nice if a heavier card stock/paper were used for the folders.,1
This product is very helpful in keeping receipts organized. Especially when traveling.,1
"I think this is a great idea, because sometimes I like to organize my papers within a folder. The negative is that the folder material is rather flimsy.",1
"I primarily use files within hanging folders, and this seems designed for vertical use as opposed to horizontal use. I need to evaluate how easy it is to file while in a drawer within hanging files. Very thin paper, I suspect they won't hold up for a long time.",1
"Works great if you only have a few items in the folder, but if you have a lot it won't hold them.",1
"I was very pleased with the folder design as it kept like file items together in one convenient spot, yet gave division. Good idea. But, the internal dividers were a bit flimsy for the general manilla folder-type construction. If these were made from the hanging-file folder material, they would be close to perfect.",1
"I'm using this to organize bills into paid, to be paid and question this bill. It's a great idea. I've never seen a folder like this before. My problem is that the material is so thin. A regular file folder has more stiffness and since I have multiple compartments here, I would prefer that the main folder be made from a material that doesn't bend because it shifts the contents of the sub tabs within the folder.",1
I wish that the pockets on the back two pockets went all the way through. Not just a flap. Otherwise it would be a great product.,1
"This is a great idea for organizing projects. I am using it for a to do file, but the different sections are ripping apart.",1
WE bought this product on a whim after seeing the store display. WE are reorganizing our personal filing system and liked being able to group related papers in one file. We were disappointed that it was somewhat flimsy. But still like the concept. Will buy again especially if made stronger. The value for these though was acceptable.,1
"I plan to use the files to keep track of my student's papers, class work and homework. I'm not sure they will hold up to daily use. I plan to reinforce the edges with book tape to strengthen them a little.",1
"Use to separate business receipts by vendor, then category. Works well for that, but need to be replaced often.",1
"Good product for organizing materials for presentations or meetings. However, on several folders in the package, the back tab was glued making it unusable without ruining the folder.",1
Used to create expense report organizers for employees Would be better if the small pocket was closed more on the opening-side. Receipts slip out too easily. Adding a fastener to the left side would also be a huge plus.,1
I liked the concept of the product but the construction is a little paper like and thin.,1
"I was unsure when I first ordered the product. But once I got the product in, it was exactly what I needed to organized my files.",1
"These were nice, I ordered them so I would have the ability to keep track of business cards and odds and ends for the executives I support. They are of the same weight and quality of standard manila folders, with just some extra folders attached. Would have liked a bit more sturdiness to the paper and more enclosure on the right to make it a full folder.",1
plan to use for documents for tax return preparation. just got to decide how i will ..,1
"I use these in my business to keep my clients paperwork sorted and easy to find what is needed,",1
the sections do not hold enough. it would be better if the dividers were not attached at the right end of the folder,1
Will be using them for organizing food service files,1
"This is a novel product that can be utilized for a variety of organizational projects. I particularly like that the bottom is closed, even though that can limit the amount of documents that will fit in each subdivision. I LOVE being able to create tabs within a single file folder. Bravo! On the downside, I think that the tab alignment makes it difficult to fit a proper, readable label on the large folder tab. Overall, though, a great idea and a solid product.",1
"I use these files for meeting pkts. I can easily seperate the documents, try to label them accordingly and send it along with my boss so he can find his documents easily. I also find it great for separating department documents. I do love using this folder!",1
"I used this product to organize my cake business. Orders, receipts, supplies.",1
Divide-it-Up is a great product for organization freaks like me! Would be useful in both home and office applications. Would have liked to have a printable tab label sheet with software to label the tabs. (Hate to write on the tabs or look for and buy label sheets. Otherwise a great product! Would buy again and would recomend.,1
"I am always trying to organize with file folders by color coding, this takes it a step further by having multiple pockets within one folder. I can't say they're durable or flimsy they're file folders and they feel like such. Be great if they were maybe a little thicker but it is what it is. Yes, they're going to get dinged up here and there and documents inside will have a bit of damage but to me, that's expected when you're dealing with things made of paper. I just wish they were more colors!",1
I use this product for my executive's travel folders. He does not need an intensive travel folder so these are great for him. I was glad to see the assorted colors as an option I am now able to assign a color for different trip categories. I think the color folders are more durable than the manilla folders.,1
It's an organized to do list with room for backup information,1
These are great for organizing materials for my coursework and helping me sort materials for my portfolio project.,1
"Used for school Very Functional and Organizational I would like better colors than prime blue, red, yellow. -- boring. Pastels are more pleasent to look at, teal, purple, emerals.. possibly glossy would be nice too.",1
I'm so excited to have one folder do more than one thing for me. This is going to change my systems!!!,1
"This is great for jobs that have a lot of parts...receipts, notes, contracts, inventory sheets, invoicing, etc.",1
"We plan on using these for our homeschool classroom. They will be very useful in organizing my 5th graders work. I'd prefer them to be a bit more thick considering they will hold a greater load. Overall, I am very satisfied with the product!",1
It is an effient way to organize multi level office organization. I wish there was a better way to store in a file cabinet though because it seems to be best used vertically but it will do the job.,1
"Item to be used for meeting organization of agenda, sign in sheet and othe information. Allows easy access to items without clips or other seperaters.",1
This product it great to keep organized I just wish it was a bit more strudy.,1
Using this product to get some job files in order. Product seems to be well made .I think it will hold up to daily use.,1
This product is excellent for filing multiple papers dealing in one subject. There are tabs to separate 4 separate files in one folder. I can take one folder and still manage all my documents. I can file under one heading and still know where to find anything related to that subject in a orderly way. I think the paper weight could be a little heavier because of the amount of paper that can be filed but that would not stop me from using this useful product.,1
"I use the folders to categorize related task, subjects or projects that are in progress.",1
"As a teacher, I'm always trying to find a better way to organize the many subjects that I teach. It will be easier to organize copies needed for a unit of study. Any chance of making a 6-tabbed folder Would be great for those math unit.",1
This version is sturdier than the previous product and with colors it maked organizing papers easy and fun. The tabs are a bit uneven though and could be better finished,1
Great way for me to organize while going to and from the office. Keeps my portable inbox sorted by category. Only wish the individual tabs could hold a little more.,1
Great for organizing house paperwork and dividing up accordingly in the smaller pockets,1
"As a grad student, I stash one of these in my laptop bag for collecting class handouts throughout the day. They're great for simple, immediate sorting, but have two shortcomings: 1) they don't hold all that many papers in each individual section 2) the manila folder material isn't as thick as an ordinary manila folder Otherwise, a nice invention. I wish office stores sold them individually! Tim",1
"It's not exactly for me personal wise, but for businesses that need to organize a few different categories in the same folders, it's fantastic!",1
I love these file folders!!! They make it so much easier to organize my filing cabinet. My only complaint is the fact that it is easy to bend and ruin the tabs. I wish that just those parts could be made of a sturdier material or at least be reinforced in some way.,1
I am using these folders to organize the Science and Social Studies units that I teach. It is working really well.,1
"As a teacher and family bookkeeper I love well-designed filing materials and the Divide It Up folder as a welcome addition. The original product was too flimsy so the decision to upgrade the cardstock weight is a big plus. I'd still like to see it in a light polyvinyl and, even better, in many colors(currently there are 3-5)- but if the cardstock makes it more affordable then they've got a winner here. I'm filing everything in it because the built-in dividers let it function like a mini-binder.",1
I had already purchased these in the plain color and I was excited to have the bright colors. I love these folders!,1
"This product was helpful for keeping track of various samples and information received for a project. I had everything all together in one regular file folder, but now I have sorted the information and it is much easier to work with without being bulky.",1
"This is great for things that you have alot of but need to seperate into smaller categories, like medical bills or expenses.. I can pull a file and find things in no time at all because its all right there but easy to find at my fingertips!",1
"I actually like these for personal and business. I use them for our automobile files at home. You can then separate purchase papers, service receipts, etc. AT work, I like them for the expense accts. and the back up receipts etc. required. I especially like that they are available in colors for ease of account identification. They are best for small quantity rather than large., however.",1
"I have wanted this product for a long time. I often have project files that require different information kept together, now I can easily access and keep information seperated within one file.",1
"I am remodeling a condo and must constantly carry my notebook containing orders and receipts. The divide-it-up works because nothing can fall out of the bottom of the folder, but it would be even better if punched for a 3-ring binder. I need several folders at a time, and that would make it easier.",1
This is a great folder for keeping projects organized and keeping all the papers/forms for each project organized in one place.,1
Really like this product. Helps organize the file much better.,1
"I like the design of Divide-It-Up folders. I wish they were made from sturdier, stiffer paper.",1
"I ordered a pack of these folders, after receiving my sample package from you, to use for my boss's meeting folders where he has multiple handouts. I like the idea of separate pockets. Could be better constructed noticed that the pockets tend to tear easily.",1
I use these folders at home for organizing recipes I want to try. I can easily locate separate categories instead of hunting through a larger pile. The folder could be a little sturdier.,1
"a little flimsy, and divider pockets could be a little deeper, but a GREAT space saving idea for sub-categories (eg, month...date).",1
"I like the fact that instead of one folder with multiple pages on a topic, I can sort the categories of the topic, each with its own section and label, within the general folder. It should be easier to find specific pages without sorting all the pages in the general folder.",1
use for billing Keeping reciepts in order and invoices in order,1
"Will be using for my coupons, wish it was a bit stronger.",1
"Great organization folder, just needs to be a little stronger.",1
"I bought for personal use but may use for business. Would like the pockets to be a bit deeper, but I had a lot of stuff for that month. But i liked the design and it works pretty well.",1
"Just perfect for assembling like items - lab reports, diagnosis, insurance.... Finally Medical by Body Part! -- Feet, Type 2, Dental, Lasik -- and in a common folder. Great help for itemized IRS.",1
I usse it to keep my circulars and it's just great to have them all (4) in one folder.,1
useful for keeping related files together but would like to be able to keep larger amount of paper in it,1
I use this to keep my monthly receipts. Works great!!,1
"I can keep everything together regarding one project and have it organized and easy to find in only one folder, not ten.",1
"I use this to prepare for meetings where I need to have multiple reports without the bulk of a binder. I also use this to separate articles on the same topic as I organize research materials for discussion. Since it is sealed on two sides, my papers don't slide out of the folder.",1
This is great to organize items within a single file. Would like to see it be made sturdier and also in other colors.,1
"Use for travel docs for the boss, training packets, routing multiple docs to group of management Would like to see it in different colors, more sturdy material, a designated place to put a label on the top cover",1
I received these as a Power Member and used them for a meeting I attended in my first time as the secretary. I was able to use one for correspondence and another for notes. The individual sections really helped me to find items with ease as opposed to searching through a folder looking for items. The only thing that would make them better for me is if the paper was a bit sturdier.,1
Love this! So much nicer than using paper clips to divide up items in a folder.,1
I am transitioning from full time employee to full time mom and this was great for the transition period of training my replacements.,1
"I use these folders both personally and business wise. I organize the jobs I do with specs, pictures, quotes and such and personally I organize my bills and such.",1
"I use these folders all the time! Class papers, Home Organizing, Kids papers, Everything. The inside dividers are the perfect concept. I would add that they need to be more durable,they tear easily and more color choices for ease in organizing.",1
This came in handy to organize multiple bank statements for accounts that have check books but not alot of statements.. however the thickness of the folder could be improved upon.,1
"This design is well thought, and comes in handy! It is great for someone that needs to organize a wider array of things in one file.",1
As soon as I saw it I knew it would help with my upcoming trip to Montreal. I'm always looking for ways to organize and this will defintely help. I've already told others about the product.,1
"I will order this product to help keep myself and my materials better organized. With three areas within the folder, it's easy to find, sort and keep on task. Would like to see this offered in colors too.",1
Would be even better if it was available in colors (I like color-coding) and made in a poly material to be durable and long-lasting,1
"easy to use. I like that it's an addition to something I already use all of the time. One improvement would be that the tabs stick out farther, hard to read when regular sized papers are in folder.",1
"I really like this folder. The one thing I would change is the stock currently, it's too thin.",1
"Recipes...low fat, low calorie, low carb.. Travel... agenda...hotels...flights Workshop...information...notes....books to read Things to do....urgent...in a week Trip....receipts...information...brochures Project....receipts.....information....brochures Stocks to buy....information... different recommendations... different",1
"I really liked the concept of this folder, I just wish that the separation dividers were graduated from top to bottom so when you put the same size papers (8x11) in them you could see the different sections above the previous ones. The way it is layed out, things are divided but they are all at the same level and not as easy to access. They are so much better than the normal file folders, though, because you can keep things in it when you tip it to the side.",1
I really like the concept of four related items in a folder. Convenient and quick. I will buy more.,1
"Useful for documents of different sizes or types such as receipts, account information, recipes, project ideas, etc. Each section can hold letter size paper if organizing by type. Bottom section is 4 tall so small or short items can be separated from full sized items to organize multi-sized items. All sections are open on only two sides which helps prevent items from falling out. Bottom section can be taped to next section to make a pocket to really hold items inside the folder. Main tab is 5 wide for long single line description and about 1/2 lower are inner tabs which are 2 wide. Also each section itself has room for labels, notes, or even attached items in addition to tab space. These are not heavy weight paper but adhesive labels on tabs will make them sturdier. Sections won't hold high volume of pages but pages can be placed on top of the sections for higher volume (same fold lines as standard folder). To use these inside a standard folder, cut off main tab to add flexibility to existing file folders.",1
Used for personal use. It is a little flimsy but will still purchase more of them.,1
"Love the concept. Interesting idea and very useable in the workplace. Great way to keep a project scope, timeline, task list, and agendas all together.",1
"I am using multiple folders together. Therefore, I would like to see this product with tabs 2 thru 4 turned to a landscape format allowing me to visually see and retrieve the information I need much quicker.",1
I bought the product for personal use but find it very useful in my business. I hoped to hole punch it to use in a binder but the size it too large or I would have to cut it down to fit.,1
I use it for my students papers and my small business,1
"As a real estate broker, I appreciate the ease in which I can keep the various documents of a transaction together. Sometimes we have various stages of a deal -- rather than paper clips I can use the dividers within the folder.",1
"As a teacher these files are terrific because they enable you to sort documents easily but the construction needs to be sturdier, definitely some kind of vinyl. I'd love to see this file done in the same material as the Pocketfiles product. I'd buy oodles of them and change my filing system. Hint-hint!",1
When on the road I have customer info that is easily available. I am not fumbling through a stack of paper.,1
"I am a Consultant and these help. A reminder, these help you to organize, they are paper and not miracle workers. They are excellent for their value and purpose. Anything other than that then you need to pay for a personal assistant.",1
"I use the product to keep related papers together in one place. I can keep meeting agenda, minutes, receipts, and to do list, in one folder. GREAT!! I would like the paper used to make the product heavier for more wear and tear as the product is very excellent for multiple use.",1
"I have used this product to organize materials for my students in centers or station activities. It is nice to be able to put directions, worksheets required, and manipulative materials together in one packet to hand out to students so everything is right there. The price at which I purchased this package will allow that they are inexpensive enough that I can have one per stuent. I do wonder how long they will last with some students though and would wish the material be more substantial. It would be helpful as well if there were a flap type pocket in the smallest division, as we use many small items when working. Right now I use an envelope to hold the small items which does work well.",1
I love anything to enhance my organizational skills and this product adds even more organization to my files and Ideas. I can create a Main Category and then add Sub-division or additional pieces of documents etc and keep everything in one file. I wish they were made in Poly or some type of Plastic. As much as I will utilize these Divide-it-Up Folders I feel they will wear them out quickly and have to purchase replacements.,1
"As a teacher, I use it to organize sets of photocopies for class use, labeling the tabs with the title of the handout. It's a tad confusing to locate the right tab for the right section of the Divide-It-Up. However, the price is great, and that's VERY important to me. Please keep making these. (Also, one of my adult students fell in love with it and uses it to organize his own handouts.)",1
Great for my small construction company. Each smaller job only needs one folder and everything can be organized within that one folder. The only downside is that everyone has the back of the top tab glued to the back of the folder and rips when you pull it apart.,1
This file is great. It organizes you completely!! I just wish that the right side would be sealed so that the little things (like receipts) won't fall out!!,1
"As someone who provides many of the materials students use in the classroom, this is an affordable way to keep them, the room, and myself organized through multiple projects. A variety of colors would allow for further organization through color-coding systems.",1
"I love the option to organize multiple topics in one file. However, the file seems very line and I would think that it would wear quickly over time.",1
"I have many print-outs of articles pertaining to diverse issues, and can mix files to arrange the information as I feel it pertains: for example,billing and shipping info can be filed with product or source info.for better cross reference",1
"It is going to eliminate the use of several folders for one topic/company. Great for sales receipts,menus,school letters,etc",1
I'm always worried that smaller pieces of paper will drop out while i'm walking down the hall for signatures or presentations. I end up clutching the folder pretty tight. Keeps receipts safe and organized too when traveling.,1
Should enable me to keep my classroom teaching materials much better organized and will cut down on the number of individual file folders I need to carry.,1
"Uses are endless...from organizing travel, to events, to financial statements. Love this file.",1
Keeps my work divided and enjoy that all in one folder. I'd recommend it!,1
"As a Project Manager, I need file folders which allow for quick access of various types of documents including those related to processes, personnel and tools. This folder allows me to grab one file for each type of meeting, rather than trying to find the right documents from numerous folders. Because the folders come in various colors, I can coordinate them to Project Management processes or specific team assignments.",1
Pockets make easier access to categories of documents for organization and presentation. More efficient than multiple file folders.,1
"Organization of all documents related to individual projects or quizzes, Would prefer sturdier construction, Would prefer dividers to be attached at fold instead of document bottom for ease of labeling,",1
Many times there are multiple components to a repetitive task. I use these folders to break it down and organize the main points. Also terrific for monthly to do that only get used once a year. Nothing falls out and I don't have to spend time searching within the file for important parts.,1
This file system helps a great deal to organize different papers that belong together for a single event or presentation. The manilla sheets are very thin and I worry that it may not hold up to transportation in a briefcase day in and day out.,1
great way to keep files organized. Different colours help as well.,1
I have projects that have different phases but did not want to set up files that would only have 1 or 2 sheets of paper in them. The Multi-Section file folders are a great solution for me.,1
I use this product for both personal and business use.,1
great to divide different job tasks and bills that are paid and to be paid,1
"Great that these come in multicolor packs. Some papers may need to be folded to fit certain tabs which may not work in some situations. Otherwise, great everyday folders. Also great for filing small pieces like receipts or stubs.",1
I used this product to organize my income tax information. It was perfect for the types of paperwork I needed to separate and archive.,1
Would like the last tab (the one on the very back) to be higher so it is more visible when the cover is closed (currently the tab is partially covered by the next tab down).,1
I plan to use it to organize bills/pd receipts before data entry and filing. Also plan to use it for various tax forms and notations/record keeping.,1
"my files are almost in the same size, so files overlap each other. it doesnt look as perfect as on the ads",1
"I like these file folders because I can contain related and similar documents, but keep them sorted, organized and separate within the same folder. Easy to grab the right paper and simple to put it back in the right spot. Classic everything has a place, and everything in its place design.",1
I use it for keeping track of Medical bills and other house expenses.,1
These folders are good for meeting prep and for organizing loose papers that need to be sorted.,1
Terrific idea for multipart projects and activities that have a variety of media and/or documents that aren't standard sized. Can better organize and visualize materials and tasks.,1
Looks like a nice answer to organize presentation papers,1
You don't lose all those little pieces of paper when you put them in these files,1
I use them to coordinate projects and have everything in one place,1
Small receipts are easy to locate and can be sorted by type,1
I needed something that allowed me to categorize papers within a file folder without adding too much bulk to the file itself. I feel this is going to help me keep my paperwork so much more organized and accessible.,1
"I use them to keep various projects organized, including meeting notes, emails, and documents. I used to use the divided folders (with the prongs on top) since those withstand most wear and tear, I don't know how well it will hold up to frequent use considering the weight of paper stock used. I suggest something more durable or coated tabs/edges. I've had to tape one folder up (at the crease) already.",1
The Divide-it-Up is great when you have paperwork that have sub-categories. I need all the help I can get when it comes to organizing. I use it for organizing receipts. The four sections help me to organize right down to the smallest things. The colors give me another option for organizational style. Divide-it-Up is a reflection of the fact that Pendaflex is the leader in innovative tools for organizing.,1
I organize my files my clients by color. I need more colors and a large number of units per package.,1
"Am using these to keep documents/receipts for taxes so it's perfect for that use. Would not be good for anyone needing to bring or carry folders in briefcase as construction is same as simple file folder tabs would be destroyed too easily. Would love to see different colors just for cosmetic reasons, unless they are available just not at the store i went to. Otherwise I love them",1
"So useful and easy to use. I love being able to put stuff in one folder, but yet divided at the same time.",1
"I wish the 3 sub-pockets held more than a few pieces of paper they get stuffed quickly. Nice that the overall folder has scores to extend it - wish the sub-folders did too. I was hoping to use this to organized complex client projects, but the capacity is too small. Probably best for sorting receipts and other small papers. You probably need to be quite organized to use this effectively. Recommended with reservtions.",1
Great space saver can use in place of 3 file folders. I like being able to organize within a single folder. I wish it came in more colors to color code subjects. I wish it was wide enough to punch holes so I could use it in a binder.,1
"I had to arrange groups of legal documents (will, power of attorney, medical directive, etc.) in a convenient folder that kept everything together and organized. This was perfect! Now I've started to use them at work to manage different projects.",1
I organize my businesses by color. More colors would be appreciated.,1
"Great for organizing your bills, less folders are need. Easy access to your bills all at one time.",1
"I keep meeting notes and pieces in these and they are good for that, but not sturdy enough for long-term archiving.",1
"This is a great idea, and they still work well, but the dividers are very flimsy (like thin paper)inside the folder, and they so not go all the way to the bottom of the folder.",1
The folder is very helpful in seperating various documents used per one specific training session. I am able to view the tabs which usually is a problem with individual file folders.,1
"I have over 250 patients that I take care of, and I need to be able to find specific documents at a moments notice. These allow me to organize all of my patient information so I can pull what I need when I need it. LOVE this product! Sometimes the glue sticks and its hard to open the folders seperately. I do not label the individual little folders, because I know what goes in each one. The tabs are a little short so it's kind of hard to write boldly. But that is really my only cons to this product!",1
"I manage documents for my father, his household, his Trust, and myself. The color coding, multiple sections help me quickly sort locate info.",1
Looking forward to organizing my papers in a new way.,1
I label the folder and add the files. Which allows me to be better organized. I would buy even more folders if they had more sections.,1
"I like the tabs so different sections of a project can be sectioned out, much like a 3 ring binder, but much less bulky. But worth noting: the longest tab at the top is really the over all file folder label, and does not have a specific pocket attached to it. Overall many uses for this product. Would like more colors to chose from.",1
I needed a system to help me manage multiple items for different projects or meetings. I am able to create a folder for each particular project so it's organized in my bag. It's not as bulky as an organizer or binder and I am able to sort documents according to purpose much easier. I wish it could expand a little more to hold a larger amount of paper.,1
Would like to see shortest tab sealed so small recipets willnot fall out,1
It's great that these can keep different sizes of paper organized and easy to read. I'll use it to keep up with my 2013 Medical filing for tax purposes.,1
The folder organizes my documents in the order they come in.,1
We were able to keep forms separated for presentation and made it easy to pull them for handout.,1
"I got these folders to keep track of my monthly spending. I used to have a file box that i would divide the smaller receipts up and put in envelopes within my folders. With these folders I can separate the receipts without the use of extra envelopes. My only complaints about these folders are the color choices are pretty boring and the dividing tabs are not full length. The first pocket is handy, the second level is great but when you get to the third tab it does not reach to the bottom of the folder, so papers can get lost in my use of the product. I still use the folder but if it was changed it would make me happier.",1
"Picked these up in hopes of better organizing my home office. The 4 tabs per folder has come in really handy and proved really useful. I've used classification folders in the past, but the pressboard construction while sturdier made the folders a bit cumbersome and well, sort of overkill for what I needed. For everyday use these new files are definitely a bargain in comparison and the construction has actually held up well.",1
I like that you can divide more than one file into a single folder with the separations,1
"This is a great product for client files! You can separate critical paperwork by year, and make it easily audit-ready. I like that the inner tabs are still visible even with full sized sheets in each pocket.",1
I use these folders to set up travel for my Executives. It's convenient to be able to break the trips in segements and have a pocket for each!!,1
"Just bought these and started re-organizing my filing cabinet. The Divide-It-Up folders are replacing my previous system of hanging file folders stuffed with file folder subsections and freeing up a ton of space! I don't feel like contents are going to spill out when I pull out a file although I do wish the exterior folder itself was a little thicker. Also, more colors would be helpful.",1
"I'm going to use these in addition to both standard files, and the computer.",1
"I am a teacher, and I use a folder to organize all the paperwork I need for the day. I can separate papers needed for each class, and those needed for meetings.",1
"File folders have typically felt lacking in effectiveness of organization, and, more specifically, typical file folders fail in sub-organization. These inner-tiered, divided file folders subdivide one folder into three easily labelled sections, offering much more usefulness than simply putting a pile of papers in a stack stuck in one single folder.",1
I can see myself using these for my home use as well as at work. I love that there are pockets and the papers you put in the folders will be secure. I only wish they were made with a little bit heavier paper.,1
LOVE this product!! Wish it came in all the rainbox colors for even better organization. :),1
"I found the folders very useful. I have my own business, work outside the home in multiple locations and have my own personal/home filing/paperwork. I love that I can organize it and that the stuff isn't falling out of the files. Cannot comment on durability since I have not been using them very long.",1
Using Divide-It-Up allows you to see what is actually in the file by just opening the folder and looking at it.

practical and can contained sorted documents in one folder,1
"No where on the package does it state half of the folders have the main tab on the left and half on the right. I needed twice as many packages to get what I needed all to the left. What a waste. I would not have bought had I known they were not all the same. Otherwise these are perfect for complex projects that need items together but separated out. Could use more colors, like green.",1

"Up until today, I didn't realize this product existed... And that's really too bad. Bought these on a whim during checkout and I am thoroughly pleased. I do a lot of papercraft, as well as creative writing, and I've always wished for a folder-ish system where I could organize various documents, templates and various bric-a-brac for a project, especially one that could handle a variety of different sized pieces that will, eventually, constitute a whole. This fits the bill - now, instead of just throwing all the various pieces, of vastly differing sizes and shapes, for a papercraft project in a stack with a binder clip, I can logically lay them out in the product's sub-folders. YES!!! While I am overall very pleased with the product, a few pieces of constructive criticism presented themselves while I was familiarizing myself with these new folders: 1) The covers feel very flimsy when compared with the side of the folder with the pockets. Because of the extra layers on the pocket side, it is much beefier, and, sometimes when I pick a full folder up, the cover pops open and documents can slide out. 2) It would be great to have a few different interior layouts of the product - sometimes when working with a lot of small pieces, seeing as how they would lend themselves to the lowest, smallest pocket, get jumbled up and confused. having a few different pocket layouts could help remedy this. 3) It would be great if the folders came in other dimensions, besides just the standard 8.5x11 size. I work with a lot of over-sized pieces of posterboard and it would be really nice to have folders to help organize them as well. A smaller, pocket-sized version would be very useful as well. 4) This final one is purely cosmetic - the folders come in only three colors. For project management purposes, having seven or eight (or more) different colors would help me keep the folders organized one color per project. Overall, I am very pleased with the product, and, if the need arises, I would absolutely purchase more packs.",1

"I am a teacher and it is important for me to keep track of student's work and confidential files. I used to have to put folders inside of folders to keep things organized. These file folders eliminate most of that double stacking. Also, it is much eaiser for me to locate important documents and work samples to present at parent meetings.

This is an excellent product for the price--One of the greatest things is that Pendaflex includes 12 files instead of 10. This is truly innovative filing and has made my day (year)!",1

I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! it came in a package of 12 so is perfect to organize my entire 2013!!!, the only think that I am not really happy about is the fact that doesn't come with labels and dont sale as individual items...I would be happy to buy an extra one or two just to add my resolutions list to start my year and the other one for my taxes and to organize my goals to be achieved with my returns.

I've been covered in hives the last 5 days because of using this detergent! Look at all the reviews on Amazon saying they had a bad allergic reaction this also!,1
I'm so sorry to write something negative about such a good company but this detergent didn't work for our family of 6. There is no scent at all so sometimes the sort of stinky stuff still has a slight ordor. Stains don't come out at all. It is very gentle for our little boy who has very sensitive skin so that part is good! But we will not be buying this again.,1

Turns out it was the laundry detergent. This get clothes clean unless there are major baby stains. I've been trying to use up the rest and notice if I run a load of pretreated bibs and barf rags, they don't come as clean as with my melaleuca detergent. Not bad, but I'll stick with my other in the future.",1
"I've been using this laundry detergent for a few months now and I can't say enough good things about it! It cleans very well, leaves a light, fresh scent and, most importantly, it's free of harsh chemicals. My daughter and I have sensitive skin so I was SO happy to finally find a detergent that didn't irritate our skin and still cleaned really well. I highly recommend this detergent!",0
"Happy with this product! Seems to be getting to clothes clean, and I think it''s a great price for something that''s a little safer than the average detergent.",1
"I have been using the liquid Honest laundry detergent for nearly four months now and just love it! From business clothes to dog blankets, this stuff is amazing. And it's free from worry of toxins!",1
"We bought this to wash our baby's clothes and are so happy with it! It gets them clean while still being gentle enough for baby's sensitive skin. We wound up using this detergent exclusively since our baby comes in contact with our clothes as well, and it works great for our clothes too!",1
I have been using Honest Laundry soap for over a year now and love it. I love that it doesn't smell like most laundry soaps and it gets our clothes clean.,1
Just feel better using a natural laundry soap for 2 year old.,1
"I've been using this laundry detergent for a few months now and I can't say enough good things about it! It cleans very well, leaves a light, fresh scent and, most importantly, it's free of harsh chemicals. My daughter and I have sensitive skin so I was SO happy to finally find a detergent that didn't irritate our skin and still cleaned really well. I highly recommend this detergent!",1
Great product and cleans clothes rather well. There is no fragrance and has been good to my sensitive skin.,1
I've been using the Honest detergent ever since I washed my babies clothes for the first time and I love it! He is now 17 months and have never had an issue. Although i'm not a fan of the other Honest products the detergent is wonderful. I once used dreft detergent and I noticed my baby got a rash. So ever since I've stuck to the honest degerent.,1
I love this product. I have been using it for at least a year. I've not had any issues with staining or clothes not being cleaned. I recommend this product to everyone. It works and it's safe!,1
Love that it's fragrance free and gentle on my baby's laundry but still gets the stains out!,1
We don't have kids so we don't have a lot of stains to contend with but this stuff cleans our clothes nicely. I love that it's gentle and free of chemicals and fragrances. I feel especially good about using it on the bed sheets. Sometimes I throw some hydrogen peroxide in the bleach dispenser for extra cleaning power.,1
This is what I use to wash my granddaughter's clothing and it's gentler than the usual baby detergents. I now use it for the entire family,1
"OK so I'm very much into more natural and safe ingredients for everything! I was looking for a laundry detergent for my baby (didn't want to use dreft) and I came across this one. I have to say I love this detergent! It leaves a very soft faint smell and it leaves her clothes so soft and looking like new. Last week I couldn't find it but needed to wash her clothes so I bought dreft I was so upset after using it, it left her clothes rough and with those little balls all over the fabric. The honest company detergent is the way to go definitely! Not only does it leave your clothes oh so soft but it is free of any harsh chemicals and is good on sensitive skin. Only downside is it doesn't come in larger quantities!",1
"This is a really good safe detergent especially for people with allergies, sensitive skin.",1
I couldn't close the cover due to a bad plastic hinge. Closing it by force would break the hinge unless you squeeze the hinge together first. I'm sending it back and look for better quality.,1
Perfect for a companion tackle box for the truck or hiking to your favorite pond.,1
I used these boxes as hardware organizers and they are very tough. I have one that I have had for 8 or 9 years now. Can never have enough.,1
Nice size to pack for an outing on the creeks where I like to get away from the crowd and take along as few things as possible.,1
Good,1
"I've owned this vacuum for close to 3 years now and have had it in service the same number of times. The service rep knew exactly what was wrong because he's worked on countless others. Do yourself a favor, buy something else.",1
Works great until it breaks I've had two and they both did the same exact thing they both power off and need parts that can never be replaced apparently great vacuum too bad it Will never turn on again and is total garbage,1
"I've owned this vacuum for close to 3 years now and have had it in service the same number of times. The service rep knew exactly what was wrong because he's worked on countless others. Do yourself a favor, buy something else.",1
One of the best vacuums I have ever owned until the handle snapped right off--bought in 2012. Had to finish vacuuming so I did until it died completely. Really bummed! Thankfully it's still under warranty so will be taking it in where I hope they can fix it. I just hope it doesn't take too long!,1
"I loved my Hoover Platinum vacuum, but after just one year the handle just broke right in half today while I was in the middle of vacuuming my carpet. I can't say this has ever happened to me with any other vacuum I have ever bought. I don't think a 300 vacuum should be made in such an inferior way.",1
"Upright is worthless. Spits out dirt, cant get into tight places, loud and bulky. I would never buy another one of these again. Only good thing is the nice long cord. The additional canister vac works better than the upright but the attachment tube to use the floor head broke, rendering it useless. Same your money!",1
All these bad reviews hit the nail on the head. We did call hoover and were directed to go to retailer to get servicing. Unfortunately they didn't want to touch the machine because it was purchased at Sears. Truly the worst vacuum ever made and it wasn't like we purchased a cheap machine. This a lemon and hoover does not make it right!,1
"The Upright Vacuum out of the box is stuck on low. The hepa filter bags probably work ok but dust is shooting out the tubes in the back which basically negates any respiratory advantages using a hepa filter. I all fairness, I like the way it vacuums (I am in a power wheel chair), however, for the above reasons I will be returning it.",1
Spent alot of time researching this product and when I purchased and got it home it never ran properly. Each time I would start it up and started to vaccum my carpet it woudl shut down. What a disappointment!! Returned it and went and bought a Dyson for 100.00 more and I LOVE IT!!,0
"I read Consumers Reports and usually agree with their recommendations. This vacuum was highly recommended so we bought one. It was very lightweight (which was good), it had decent suction (which was OK), but it had a problem switching from High to Low via the switch mounted on the handle just below the power button. No problem, returned it and got another one -- same issue. Just like the first unit, the switch was intermittent -- sometimes it worked, mostly it didn't. Hoover has an obvious design issue here. We ended up with a Dyson - significantly more but what a machine...",0
"Originally I reviewed this Hoover Vacuum in 11/2010 (on Walmart website) after I first purchased it at that time I gave it 5 stars there since then my user opinion has *changed*.. In October 2012 the ergonomic handle had to be replaced since it was coming apart which I guess stemmed from the oils in my hand when using the vacuum (design flaw).. The vacuum was under 60 month warranty so Hoover directed me to a local vacuum dealer they recommended here in Florida (second mistake) it was replaced.. While I only vacuum weekly I started to notice a lack of suction power for this vacuum which was disappointing me big time, but not wanting to spend money again I continued on with it.. I clean the wheels, brushes rollers frequently change the bag often whether it needs it or not so not sure what the problem is with this vacuum.. I originally purchased this vacuum to replace my Sears canister vacuum for poor performance, but now I am about to throw in the towel on this one too since its not worth the aggravation would like a vacuum with more suction power to keep my carpets fresh I actually hate to vacuum now because of this issue with this Hoover vacuum.. Hope others that have purchased this vacuum have better luck with it..",1
"The upright does (did) a wonderful job until today when I was body slammed by the same peril that did in my last vacuum, plastic parts. Apparently the engineers who constructed this model were in a hurry because they did not adequately assess the forces where the power/control handle meets the shaft. Today mine snapped off at that point without warning. I got this model in Novemeber 2010 because it had top ranking with Consumer Reports. Likewise my prior vac, Kenmore canister, carried a top ranking and plastic fatigue failure in the handle assembly was the culprit there too. Even though I am a guy I am not rough with these units. What I don't understand is the failure to use metal at key stress points so that this does not happen. I'd willingly pay more money for a product that endures.",1
"Loved this machine until I replaced my worn out carpet with a low freize. It will not roll over it at all, let Hoover know of the problem and they said it is not designed for high pile carpet or plush padding underneath carpet. They said to return it and by a Hoover with a manual adjusting carpet height button. Well Hoover I've had this for over a year, so I'm out of luck on the return. If I do get a new vacuum it won't be a Hoover because you certainly don't stand behind your product......boasting of an automatic heighth adjuster on this vacuum that really doesn't work.....shame on you for taking my hard earned money!!! I notice that this machine is not for sale anymore in stores...wonder why Please don't buy this machine if you ever plan to put in nice carpet!",1
I like this vacuum with the HUGE exception that the handle has snapped in half twice now. It snaps just below where the top cord wrap is located. Last time it took several weeks to get it repaired and service center said it was a challenging fix. Now I'm trying to find somewhere to repair it again. The closest location looks to be an hour away from my house and I'm not sure I want to go without a vacuum for several weeks again. Bad design!,1
I bought this product in January 2012 and now the handle broke at the top assembly. I would expect a vacuum cleaner to last longer than this. I see from other reviews that I am not the only one with this problem.,1
"Bought based on recommendation by leading consumer magazine. You get two vacs in the box, one is a bagged upright and the other is a small corded vac with a shoulder strap. The upright does a so-so job on carpets and the other vac was nearly useless for uncarpeted floors and awkward to carry around. Returned these and bought a Dyson DC50.",1
"I bought this vacuum on September 8th 2009. Two days before Christmas it just started to shut off. I couldn't get a hold of anyone until the 28th to find where to take it for repair.When I finally got it in on the 28th the repair guy laughed and said it was just their cheap machine with a longer warranty. And advised me to purchase a different vacuum because it would take forever to get the parts. Well, it's January 22nd and still the parts have not come in. Turns out they close for weeks after Christmas and do not reopen until January 11th! So I am SOL and should just buy a new one because they can't do anything for me.The vacuum did pick up well, but I could have done better and gotten away cheaper by going to a store that specializes in vacuums. They would of been able to tell me to stay away.",1
"I purchased this and loved it at first as it was so light weight. However I got new carpet that was a bit taller and now I cannot move it across the floor. The self adjusting height is nonexistent. When I wrote to Hoover, they just said I must have purchased the wrong vacuum for the carpet. There is no information regarding carpet type in the promotional materials. Don't buy this product.",1
"Right out the box...I assembled the vacuum and was excited. I started using the canister and loved it. I would have loved a bag to keep everything together, but I accepted because I loved it. THEN...I used the upright. Still in one room, the sensor light comes on after 5mins of use! Since then the Hoover helpdesk ONLY tells me to send it to a Hoover site for maintenance or Return it to the store. O**ck it is! My sister raved about it and never reported sensor problems.",1
"Impossible to push on freize carpet with moderatly high pile. Head does not adjust to accomodate higher pile carpet. Works great with plush low plie. Contacted Hoover and they said tough luck. I have to give it away, and get another vacuum that will work on freize carpet.",1
"Loved this machine until I replaced my worn out carpet with a low freize. It will not roll over it at all, let Hoover know of the problem and they said it is not designed for high pile carpet or plush padding underneath carpet.

I notice that this machine is not for sale anymore in stores...wonder why Please don't buy this machine if you ever plan to put in nice carpet!",1
On sale because you cannot push it in plush carpet. Even an employee said so. DO NOT BUY!!,1
"I bought this vaccum on 5-1-11, it worked fine for 14 months and the handle just snapped in half while I was sweeping one day. It was replaced on 8-1-12 after not being able to be repaired. The same exact thing happened last week again, handle broke! It was only 10 months old!",1
"I have had this vacuum for years and really liked it. It is lightweight and it uses premium bags. We just got new carpeting throughout our home. It is plusher than the old carpeting, but by no means a thick shag. I was very disappointed to find we could hardly push this vacuum across it. Auto height adjustment is a joke. I'm now faced with having to purchase a new vacuum cleaner.",1
The automatic height adjustment does not work if you have plush carpet. I was completely unable to move it across my carpet and had to return the vacuum the next day. It would probably work okay if you have a low and short carpet.,1
"We have owned this vacuum for over a year now. Worked great until we replaced a large room with thick pile, high quality carpet. The auto height adjustment feature does not work properly and continually shuts off the vacuum. In our opinion this is a major flaw and can not recommend this Hoover model.",1
Liked the large bag - hate bagless vacuums because of the mess. But the handle broke just above the bag and it was 200 for the replacement part. That is pretty much the cost of a new one so no value to that. Went with a cheap bagless figured I would just throw it away if a part broke.,1
I had the vacuum for 2 weeks before there was a problem with the electrical. There were spark-type flashes coming from the base and then it just stopped any suction and would not work. In addition the bags are much more expensive than other bags so overall I would not recommend this product.,0
"I had the same experience as GAK2010. The vacuum power light would flash, then the vacuum would turn off. The check bag light never went on, but I discovered the bag was 3/4 full. I changed the bag and also pulled a thread and some dust clogs from the brush. It than ran for about 20 minutes then repeated the problem. I took it to a vacuum repair shop and he cleaned it out thoroughly. 42 later, it continued to shut off. I did not take it t the authorized dealer because he has a terrible reputation, and does not even sell Hoovers. I called Hoover and they suggested I clean the filter under the bag. Didn't solve the problem!",1
"I thought I was getting a good vacuum based on reviews I read and b/c I had a Hoover previously that lasted 15+ years, but I'm extremely disappointed. I am having to take this vacuum into the repair shop for the second time in 2 years! The first was because the power kept shutting off by itself and now because the entire handle broke off (and I am just doing regular vacuuming on regular carpet). Sure, there is a 5 year warranty, but the service centers are not convenient in any way. Other things I dislike about the vacuum is that it does not adjust to carpet height, and the power button is located in the worst place. Also, the canister is very loud and the hose continually comes out as I'm vacuuming b/c it doesn't have good latch to keep it attached.",1
Was very dissappointed. Worked ok on regular carpeting but the sensor that supposedly adjusts from one floor surface to another simply does not work. Looks nice...would have enjoyed the cannister vacuum... but returned it for a less expensive Hoover Windtunnel that works much much better for our needs.,0
"I purchased my Hoover Platinum in Nov 2010 to replace another well known vacuum that I had. I specifically selected Hoover because I had Hoover vac's in the past Hoover has a good reliable name. I love the vacuum however, I don't like having to use a separate vac for tools that's bothersome to me. I've just recently replaced the belt brushroller (easy to do) which I felt was about right for 2 yrs of once a week vacuuming. HOWEVER, I was shocked yesterday when I noticed that the inside of the ergonomic handle was peeling away that was very unexpected for a Hoover product in this price point. Sadly this issue with the handle peeling away bothers me since it now means that this vacuum is not really a Platinum but more like Stainless Steel has reached the end of its life span after 2 years.",1
"Nice vacuum cleaner, if you DON'T have thick pile carpeting. Beater bar does not automatically adjust as stated. Vacuum shuts down automatically on thick pile, high quality carpet. I don't recommend. This is major flaw. My opinion, purchase a vacuum where you can individually adjust the height of the beater bar.",0
"I the Hoover Platinum Collection and was very happy with it. Then one day the on/off switch started blinking and it has not worked since. The motor will run if you hold it at a 45 degree angle but if you try to run it like a regular sweeper it stops running. For the price it should run better. Unfortunately I do not have my receipt, I have the owners manual, but no receipt. Interestingly enough I had an old Hoover Elite Supreme in the basement and that is what I have been using, it still runs:(",1
"We have owned this vacuum cleaner for several years and can say it's wonderful except for one thing.It cleans well, uses bags (why would someone not?) and is very lightweight.The handle has broken off twice, The second time after paying a vacuum repair shop to fix it. Otherwise a 5 star.",1
"I tested four vacuum cleaners. The Dyson DC 41, this vacuum, the shark navigator lift away, and the shark rotator professional. There is not much to say about what I liked about this vacuum. The edge cleaning that it boasts is laughable at best, and the boast about direct air cleaning, also leaves much to be desired, though it did vacuum acceptably. The canister vacuum is virtually useless. It could not even pick up the loose hair from tile floor without me running over it multiple times with that brush attachment. For the price, I definitely expected more, and was sadly disappointed by that name, considering I came from an older Hoover that did its job very well. I settled on the shark rotator pro for it's versatility, price, weight, and vacuuming power.",1
"Being a Hoover Platinum Collection unit, I really expected better performance based on my perceived reputation of Hoover vacuums. Below average suction on floor unit; no on-board tools. Must use second portable unit in package that has hand tools. Bag indicator light on handle of floor unit keeps lighting up as ""check bag"". Checked bag and it was not full and was installed correctly. I plan on returning.",1
I have 3 dogs and a lot of tile. I liked the Oreck much better. It did a lot better on the Tile. ... I took the Hoover back to the store where I bought it.,1
"It works wonders, when it works. I have pets that have shorter hair, so it doesn't get tangled in the brush. My vacuum shuts itself off ALL the time. I'm extremely disappointed in how much money I spent on this vacuum and I'm not even able to vacuum my entire house. My house isn't huge either, 1300 square feet and most days I'm lucky if I can even vacuum my living room without it shutting off. I was so impressed when I got it home, but I've had it for a year and a half and I'm so disappointed. Maybe I got a bad one and it can be fixed. I'm hoping so, if not, I don't think I'd spend good money on another hoover again for it to last shorter time than my cheap one did.",1
"Great vacuum cleaner. Easy to use, less dusty than others due to hypoallergenic bags. Would prefer ease of on-board attachments versus the separate smaller unit though. This vacuum was a great wee cleaner for 5 years then the handle snapped near the top where I can see it is actually two parts joined together. Unfortunately this design is a weak spot. Everything else is still working great but without the upright handle it's really no longer functional and seems a waste of a good machine. :(",1
"I bought into the idea that, in trade for a lighter vacuum, I could go without an attached hose and use the separate shoulder canister for tighter or raised spaces, but that was a mistake. This vacuum worked well (before the expensive handle portion just broke in two during normal use, a few months after the warranty expired), but the shoulder-strap canister is screamingly loud and clumsy, with a cord that was everywhere you didn't want it to be. In my older home, we have a lot of nooks the vacuum just wouldn't go, and it seemed cobwebs always formed one inch above the vacuum's suction. Without an attached hose at the ready, you're just going over everything twice.",1
"Bag is a pain to clean and the suction is average. I have had it for two years and it is still going, but I would not buy again.",1
"There were things to like about the Hoover, but enough things to not like that I returned it after a week. -I like automatic height adjustment, but it is done poorly on this vacuum it does not lower enough to fluff up the carpet. I think it is because the small height wheels are in front of the beater bar and keep it too high off the ground. The small wheels on my old Oreck were behind the beater bar so it got closer to the carpet. The vacuum has very good suction, but the carpet does not have that nice fluffy look after vacuuming. -The vacuum is light weight, but poor ergonomics made using it a chore. It hurt my shoulder and neck every time I used it. I also noticed I was much more tired after vacuuming my house with the Hoover than with my other vacuum. -The power cord is nice and long, but of very poor lightweight quality. It frequently made knots of itself, and I would have to stop, go over to it, and unwind the knots. I also ran over the cord once...if you did that many times, your cord will be eaten up. -The furniture guard did not work well...it left a scuff in some molding. I wanted to like the vacuum, as it seemed a good update to an Oreck. It had nice controls, a full bag light, and has good suction. But I ended up returning it as it doesn't fluff up the carpet, didn't seem to get up dog hair as well, and it's poor ergonomics made using it a chore.",0
"Although I really like the upright bagged vacuum, I would prefer it have on-board tools so I can vacuum the nook-and-crannies at the same time as the main floor. After vacumming the floors with the upright, I went back carrying the hand-held vacuum, but it wouldn't stay on my shoulder and I didn't want to use one hand to carry it, the hose kept coming off of it (the locking mechanism is weak), and it had very poor suction. Tried using the hand-held vacuum to vacuum carpeted stairs and the brush head would not stay on. I thought about keeping the upright and getting a better-quality hand-held, but this set was already $300 ... I don't want to spend more now!",1
"I really wanted to like this vacuum cleaner and chose it over the dyson, mainly due to the 6 year limited warranty. It's lightweight and easy enough to maneuver; however, it doesn't work well on tile and wood flooring. I had to go back over the floors 3 times to pick up little bits that it kept missing. On my area carpets, it sucks too hard & it is difficult to use. This vacuum replaced my old Hoover Futura upright which was ungainly but had pretty good suction. Unfortunately, the old Futura does a better job than this new one. The cord is way too long and keeps getting tangled and at one point it sucked it up. However, the most annoying thing is that the on/off button is located on the handle and whenever I'm pushing it across the floor I inadvertently turn it off. This happened about 10 times while vacuuming my living room. I really don't want to get a dyson--maybe I'll look at the new Hoover canister that's coming out this month. But I'll also look at a Miele, which has a 7 year warranty.",1
"I just replaced my fairly new 9lb hoover light and clean lightweight vacuum that I absolutely loved with the new lightweight platinum. My mother wanted my hoover 9lb so I needed to buy another hoover lightweight. The platinum is 12lbs and is a fantastic vacuum if only you could turn the roller brush off (I couldn't on my other hoover lightweight) and if there was a true auto height adjustment that would raise it high enough to do my modern fashion shag rug and bath mats (again, I couldn't on my other hoover lightweight). I've had it for a week but think I will return it for the reasons stated above. The new platinum lightweight weights 3lbs more than my previous hoover lightweight and it does not do anymore than my previous one. For me, it was a waste of money. If you do not have really high pile rugs or bath mats this is a fantastic vacuum. I wish it would have worked for me.",1
"Bought the Hoover and Oreck for comparison. Hoover seems stronger but can't find any specs for the vac or canister. Hoovers lights are in a bad place, casting a shadow when vacuuming. The wheels on the Hoover feel harder like plastic and very cheap compared to Oreck. When plugged in, the on/off switch stays lit wasting electricity. Tools on the Hoover feel cheap and does not include as many attachments as the Oreck. Oreck includes annual tuneups.... Hoover closed there stores and its harder to findsomeone to work on it.",1
"My new Hoover vacuum arrived yesterday. At this price, it should arrive assembled. ... Next, the instructions are pathetic, non existent. They should have clear instructions in a real manual, not a tissue paper hand-out. Lastly, Hoover doesn't even identify the loose parts so, you don't even know what they are. I think this purchase was a mistake. The devil is always in the details. You can tell that Hoover doesn't care.",1
I was glad to find this model! I have lower back problems and cannot use most vacuums. This one is perfect!,1
"I use this vacuum every day. Have carpet mostly. Picks up cat hair great. The only thing negative about this product is that it is very noisy. Other wise a great vacuum and I love the canister, very light weight and easy to use.",1
"I use on my carpets, stairs and furniture. I like that it is light weight but I realy miss the retractable power cord. The part of vacuuming I dislike the most is winding up the power cord.",1
Only have about two weeks but love everything about it. Lighweight and you feel the powerful suction. The separate hand held with attachments is a major plus. Would recommend,1
I purchased this vac and love the power. The cord seems longer than any other vac I've had. I can only wait and see how long the suction will last........hopefully for years.,1
We bought this vacuum because it was lightweight thinking that it would be easier to push on our thick carpet. It is not. It is even worse than our current vacuum. That being said if you have normal height carpet or a Berber...something that is not an inch thick it works great! It has amazing suction.,1
"Just received the Hoover Playinum Upright with the canister vac a few weeks ago to replace a 12 year old Hoover. So far it seems like a good buy for the discounted price of 208 online. Not sure it would be worth the 299 in-store price. My wife likes both, so only time will tell about the quality.",1
"This upright vaccum does all it claims to do. The only downfall to the upright is it does not have an ajustable leveler for shag then floor. I love the light on when bag is full. However, the canister vaccum does not have this feature. However, it does pick up well on my hard surfaces.",1
"Extremely light (great for ease-of-use for our children), which is why it doesn't need to be self-propelled, unlike our prior, extremely heavy Hoover vacuum. Nice bright light effectively lightens the area being vacuumed. We've only had it a couple weeks, but we we really like it so far.",1
This Hoover Platinum is perfect for a large busy household. The canister is so easy to carry on shoulder and the upright is great for rugs and carpet ! my running joke with my husband is that Hoover is the one vacuum I can count on to really Suck HaHa,1
"My wife has gone through 3 of these models and all worked great until about a year or two after purchase, that is when trouble starts and its always the same thing. Inside the handle is a modular connector with four pins that attach to another connector which bring electric to the motor. Every time our vacuums failed due to one of the pins showing burnt or melted plastic either from bad connection or overheating. By the time this happens your on your own so either buy another or pick some other model. I wish Hoover would have looked into this when this model first came out to market.",1
"This is a GREAT vacuum! I've used it now for almost a year. Great suction, really lightweight without losing power! No parts have broken, no repair problems at all. In general, a really good vacuum.HOWEVER, I replaced my plush carpeting with the new Frieze, and now am looking for a new vacuum since this vacuum is VERY HARD to push on this new style of carpeting. If you have this type of carpeting, consider another model. If not, it will do a nice job for you. Keep in mind also, no onboard tools. Must use the companion portable vac. Bags are hard to find for both, must order either from Hoover, or you can get a great price on , so that's no big deal, but plan ahead -)Overall, unless you have the semi-shag Frieze carpeting, it is wonderful!",1
"Did a lot of research online and with Consumer Reports and decided to go with this vac, mainly because if it's good ratings but also because it was lightweight. Haven't used the included canister vac yet but I'm sure it's helpful for stairs. Upright is very simple to operate/push. My only complaint is the Q-type vac bags you need to use for the upright are really difficult to find. The WalMart site showed a different vac bag along side of it when I purchased, so I got those, only to realize once I read the instructions, that they take Q-type. Had to order online at Amazon. Can't find any stores that sell them. I just stocked up. Overall it seems like a good vac and wasn't overly expensive. WalMart def had the best price on this model.",1
"The Bad such as it is, is that the Porta Power canister vac hasn't had much visible evolution over the years, other than to get rid of the gaskets inside the end of the wand. (Actually, that's a big plus! - I used to have a commercial Porta Power and that gasket gave me fits.) Now for the Good. No more getting dust in the face when emptying the vacuum cleaner. I used to have a Dyson Animal, and while not needing bags was nice, it was all but impossible to not get a cloud of dust when emptying it. Two other big pluses over the Dyson are that the Platinum's head is thinner, so I can get further under funiture, and by switching to low suction, I can do area rugs that were completely impossible with the Dyson.",1
"When we first bought our hoover we really loved it. It really lifted up our carpet and made it look like new again! I bought this hoover Windtunnel Model U6465-900 years ago and it blows dust out when I vacuumed. Now the smell of dust is bothering me. When I took it into be service they didn't fix this problem. This has a bag and two filters. One of them is a 6- stage micro filtration filter. My question is.... Because my vacuum is out of warranty, does any one know if hoover came out with a vacuum that doesn't blow out dust and smell like dust when you turn on the vacuum Because how well it lifts my carpet and makes it look good, I would buy a hoover if they fixed this problem. I need to replace the brush, filters and bag, so I need to make up my mind up on keeping it or buying a new one.",1
"After consulting Consumer Reports, I originally bought the U6485900 (I previously mistakenly put this review on that model) for the self-propel feature (to replace my U5753-960 that I bought in 2007 and still works great but is too heavy to push around -27 lbs) but the power button and self- propel buttons got stuck the first day I used it so I returned it for this one. I've used it only twice but it's lighweight and powerful. I could do without the automatic height adjuster since my carpet is old and uneven so it seizes up somewhat over the uneven areas making it hard to push. The shiny attachments keep falling off when I use the small cannister so I use my older ones. But since it was such a good price on Walmart.com-188 and Consumer Reports listed the retail price as 400 I figure I got a good deal.",1
"I purchased this product based on two things. I wanted to get away from bagless and I wanted to buy a quality vac. I was so tired of vaccuming up a huge pile of junk and then having to empty it out and then clean out the filter. I think all the dirt that I had just sucked up went right back into the air and into my house! I know that bags cost money but it does not compare to the frustration I feel when I am emptying a bagless. There weren't that many bagged vaccums to choose from in the stores but I am positive that I made the right choice. The Hoover did cost more than I had planned to spend but, I got the quality I hoped for. My carpets looked fantastic after just one cleaning! The sleek old-school style and windtunnel purring of the motor was another plus. You get what you pay for, right.",1
"My housekeeper is very happy with both units. I'm not so happy using it on my VERY high cut pile 8 x 12 area rug. I have a difficult time moving the vac and find that I have to drag it rather than moving it backwards and forwards. On the lower setting it handles smaller area rugs very well. The cannister unit works well on all my wooden shutters, wood walls, popcorn ceilings, and fan blades. Not so good on the upholstery. Short of using duct tape, the wand and accessories don't stay together well. I have been unable to find filters in any retail store however, just found them on this site. They are fairly pricey however, I have no resident family and my dog doesn't shed so they have lasted quite a long time. If I had it to do over, I'd have kept my old upright that self propelled!",1
Like the vacuum's light weight. It does the job well and not too noisy. Both units have bags which is really nice so the stuff doesn't get air borned when u empty it.,1
I would have given it a 5-star except I wish it had manual height adjustment. We have a thick sheer-cut carpet and it makes a 5-line marking pattern when vacuuming.,0
"I have had this vacuum for 3 months now. I do home daycare and have a yellow lab so I vacuum daily. I'm really happy to have such a light weight vacuum now. My old vacuum weighed 21 lbs! I don't miss the onboard accessories because I don't use those daily. I really like the small accessory vacuum that comes with it for those occasional jobs. There are 3 things I dislike with this vacuum. (1) The smell! It has that hot, dog fur smell and had that right from the start. (2) No dirt sensor light. I loved that feature on my old vacuum, however, my husband and sons are very happy to vacuum without waiting for a light to tell them when they are done. (3) The suction is too strong, even on low, to vacuum my throw rugs. Overall, it does a great job without the extra weight!",1
"I have had this vacuum for over two years. I like to wait to review a product until I have used it for a period of time. This vacuum is lightweight and easy to bring up and down stairs, can be lifted to do a quick job on stairs, is powerful with great suction and pretty easy to maneuver. It is a bit noisy, but not much more than any other vacuum. The bags are easy to change and last for a long time. It is so lightweight I even use it to vacuum the seats of furniture (getting rid of cat hair). Durable, efficient and well worth the money! The canister vacuum that came with the unit is very noisy and OK for hard surfaces and corners. However I find that the edge suction on the upright does a great job so I only have to concentrate on the corners about once a month.",1
"We've gone through numerous vacuums and all seem to have some type of downside. The Hoover Platinum UH30010COM seems to have the best blend of features and value that we have experienced. The two vacuum design (one standup and one portable) is a great convenience and optimization of features. This allows the upright to be very light (at 11 lbs it is almost 50 lighter than most uprights). The portable is very convenient for tight spaces and especially the stairs. My wife used to dangerously use the hose attachment from our old upright on the stairs. Also I believe the bagged design is superior to a bagless design. The bag is huge and provides a much cleaner sanitary disposal of collected dust and carpet fibers. The one drawback is that the upright can be hard to push on densely packed carpet. To be fair, many vacuums have the same issue. Our Eureka vacuum is impossible to push. This Hoover is difficult to push on some of our carpets but is still acceptable. If it wasn't for this we would give it a 5 star rating.",0
I had this vacuum for 10 years but the handle finally snapped. The handle grip will also deteriorate over time and will turn from a comfy rubber grip into a skin tag like grip. Yeah... I know. Gross right. The bags on this vacuum are of very high quality and will last you ages before you have to change them. Each of them lasted me about 2 years. I also love that this vacuum has a serpentine style belt so you will basically never have to change it. This vacuum will not work very well on shag or dense/thick carpet but it is great for medium to low pile carpet which most homes have. The canister vacuum in this combo is dinkey and basically pointless. do yourself a favor and go get the hoover envy hush also so you can use the attachments and bare floor nozzle on that. Overall I think that this is a product that you should consider but the orecks on Amazon right now are a good deal. Please do your research and don't waste your money. Have a good day.,1
"I've owned this hoover for almost three months and use it every few days. It looks great. Set up was easy. The upright is very light. Love that. I can vacuum the whole house and not feel tired. It cleans quite well on carpet, but fairly well on hardwood. It picks up most stuff on hardwood, but it does tend to send some hard dirt flying across the room (and that is on the low setting). It is quite noisy, but i dont mind that too much. The bags are pretty big. I still have not had to replace the one i got with the hoover. BUT the bags are difficult to find and quite expensive. I tried to buy from the hoover website but they were always out of stock. i dont understand how the manufacturers can be out of stock for months. The canister has very good suction. Noisy but thats ok. It is a little awkward to use, and to store. You have to wind the cord around the canister and just let the hose lie next to it. No place to put the attachments, so you have to store that separately, which is annoying bcoz you have to go and get it every time you want to change attachments. But basically, both the upright and canister are good vacuums.",0
This is a great combo vacuum set except that the upright is one of the loudest vacuums that I have ever used. The canister works well but sometimes the attachments easily fall off even though you think they are on tight.,1
"So happy to have found a decent vacuum with bags that provides good suction for cleaning my carpets without throwing dust particles and pet hair back into the air! As an allergy sufferer, ""bagless"" vacuums defeat the purpose of cleaning my house. I am very pleased with this piece of equipment, and look forward to a clean house and using less tissues this allergy season!",1
"The vacuum cleaner itself seems to be amazing. It got dog hair right up off my oriental rug that I couldn't seem to get clean with my previous vacuum cleaner. The little hand held vacuum cleaner worked great to begin, with but the suction has diminished when I put in a new bag.",1
LIght weight and very nice to use and powerful and the canister is nice too,1
"opened it today and the reason for purchase was 1 it comes with two vacums one specifically needed for stairs and 2 the other for my wife so she doesnt have to dragg our number one vaccum 'the boss' made by eurika with smartvac up and down everytime she needs to vacum. i only used it for a dry run today she and i love how light it is and it has a ton of power and leaves great lines in our new carpet, the hand held and shoulder strap for the other works great for stairs, also very light and easy for my wife, only one setting for air speed for the hand held, the standup has two air speed settings which i beleive the lower one irs for tile or wood so it doesnt blow dirt away,the stand up is great for stairs also it only ways a few pounds and has extra handles so u can hold it side ways and use it o stairs,and its a good lookin vacnegetives as for now neither vacum has auto roll up for cords and the cords are short 15 feet to ill probly have to buy an extension cord so she doesnt have to keep oveing the plug, the stair vac doesnt have a rotating brush like a normal vac but it works, i can see using this vac in a car and getting corners easier put it over shoulder and go to townoverall it was a house warming gift but it was purchased for 332 and with a 10 percent discount the standup performs just as good as our boos vac only draw bak it doesnt have ajustments for heght of vac for the different carpet if u have diff carpet it might not work for u need the adjustment but overall im happy with it its perfect for what we are asking out of it and we took car3e of 2 birds with one stone",1
good value. canister is fine for steps and small areas,1
"Purchased based on good review from Consumer Reports. Overall very pleased with performance of upright vacuum. Powerful headlight, full bag indicator, high/low speed, but self-adjusting head digs deep into thick-pile carpeting making vacuuming a real workout. I'm not kidding! I sweat! Easier to pull than to push. At least the vacuum automatically turns off if stalled for too long.Slightly difficult to lift if vacuuming stairs for example, as handle for second hand is located underneath the bag, rather than on top of it.No ""quick release"" for the cord. So you have to unwrap the cord one loop at a time. Cord exits the upright near the top of the handle, but would be better if it came out as high as it could. I'm constantly holding the cord as I vacuum and at least I don't have to reach that far down for it. Cord is of a good length. I only have to plug it in twice to clean the entire house.Less experience with the canister. Noisy, as others have noted, and container for dirt is somewhat small. It's more like a large, plug-in Dust Buster. But I like the idea of a separate unit. No extra hoses or tools on upright.",1
"This vacuum was purchased to replace another Hoover vacuum that was falling apart due to poor construction. This is a vast improvement over that model. It was easy to assemble, is light weight and has great suction. However, it is VERY NOISY.",1
"Very good vacuum. After going through 1 vacuum every 18 mos, we decided to go to a simple design (less to break). The gimmicke vacuums seem to be cheaply made, and lose suction after 6 mos or so.",1
"I've used this vacuum for the last month and it has been great. I'm used to bagless vacuums so having the bag is a nice treat - since I don't have to see the dirt all over again. It is a one pass vacuum and goes from carpets to bare floors without having to press any switches. The on/off switch is in a great location and the one 'switch' it has it to switch from low to high suction. I've never used the low function and I'm not really sure why it's there.The separate canister is pretty good. It doesn't have as much suction as the upright but it gets the job done. Being able to put it on your shoulder and walk around the house (with the extra long cord) has been great. I do have two issues with this though; first, I miss having the ability to use the attachments during the course of my vacuuming as it is a whole separate appliance. With this, I'm less likely to do a complete job because once I'm done with vacuuming, I just want to be done. Second, the storage of it is awkward. It doesn't fit within itself at all.",1
"I purchased this vacuum as a trial for my housekeeping staff. They love it and fight over who gets to use this vacuum. It is lightweight, yet powerful enough to clean up fine beach sand. The small canister vacuum was a welcome bonus.",1
"The upright vacuum is great - lightweight, great headlight, works fantastic on carpet and moderately so on hardwood and tile floors, not too loud. No real complaints there.The canister vacuum also has great suction, but there are a few drawbacks: it's noisy like you wouldn't believe, the connection for the hose to the body of the canister vac is flaky and doesn't always keep the hose ""locked"" in place, there's no bag full indicator light as in the upright, and the exhaust ports could blow other material around if the unit is left on the floor. Be sure to wear hearing protection (I'm serious about this) when using the canister vac for any length of time.",1
"The Hoover is a good mid-priced vacuum. It's great on carpets. It does not pick up as much on hardwood floors. The best part is the portable Hoover that comes with the unit. You can walk around with it and vacuum the sofa, cobwebs on the wall, the car interior, etc. It has an attached hose, so it is more versatile than most of the portable ""mini vacs"". I assembled both vacuums and had them running in only ten minutes or so.",1
"Had another brand upright as we have 60% carpeting, and always had a backache when done due to difficulty of turning, pulling and getting up and down stairs. With the Hoover Platinum, it is light weight, turns easily, and picks up dog hair well. Plus the canister is perfect for vacuuming stairs and my car. If you put the carrying strap over your head and shoulder it stays pretty well and is not heavy. My only complaint is that the extra long cord on the upright gets in the way.",1
"I have had some great ""wind tunnel"" and bagless vacuums, however they get clogged up and stop working right with in a year or two. I have always had vacuums similar to this one at my store. So we decided to buy this one. I am very pleased.",1
"This vacuum offers lightweight portability and decent suction. However, I prefer onboard attachments like my old Wind Tunnel had. The separate cannister vac is nice and portable, but it lacks the suction of the full size machin.",1
"In spite of having lots of suction, unit is poor at ""edge"" cleaning. This replaces a very heavy upright, so the lighter weight is a big plus. There is no height adjustment for carpeting, so is difficult to use on shag. On shag one must raise the unit to move forward and pull back across carpet.Pushing unit forward on shag Very difficult. The canister works very well.Lots of power.",1
"Have only used these vacuums for a short time, but both seem to work very well. I like having the smalll portable one and the regular upright. I've only used one attachment so far, it did the job.",1
"This seems to be the answer to my problems. Hard woods downstairs, carpet upstairs, and carpeted stairs in-between. Having two units makes it easy to swap among floor types. and the shoulder canister is easy to use on stairs. All I need is a light to tell me when bags get full.",1
"Good vacuum for money. Very lightweight. It is kind of noisy, and could use a height adjustment setting.",1
"Bought the vacuum because of weight of our previous one...was very difficult for my wife to carry it upstairs. This one is very light and the suction is tremendous. However, our bedroom carpet is deep and plush. The self adjusting feature doesn't adjust enough for this type carpet. The machine is very hard to push on the carpet, and the brush and wheels leave deep tracks. We have to rake the carpet after vacuuming. I recommend the vacuum if your carpet is not the deep and plush variety.",1
I like the buttons that light up and they are just at your finger-tips. The Vacuum is lightweight to move around and the power is great too. The vacuum is so lightweight and powerful that it almost wants to propel itself across the carpet. I also like that there is a collection of the platinum Vacuum products which I have 4.,1
Haven't gotten a chance to use. Hope to use this weekend.,1
"I have two Siberian Huskies so I needed a vacuum capable of picking up a ton of dog hair. So far this vacuum has exceeded my expectations. It has a tremendous amount of power and is very light and easy to use. Works great on wood, tile, and carpet. The only downside is the lack of attachments to the vacuum. It comes with a smaller separate vacuum pack but it is a pain to have to switch them out just to get under the furniture.",1
"I have been using this vacumm for 2 months. so far, I am very happy with this product. It is lighth in weight compare to other similar style vacuums. it cleans very well for wall to wall carpets. thanks to the other reviews, I am careful in using the handle since some people .complained that the handle breaks easily. I am giving 4 stars only because I have use this product for 2 months.the small vacuum is helpful for small spaces and corners. it is true that the tube is kind of short.",0
"imho, this vac would be great for all carpet floors only. our floors are all hardwood with area rugs. we had to return and exchanged for the hoover wind tunnel self propel. very happy now with our new wind tunnel.",0
The upright is lightweight and powerful; works just as well on bare floor as it does on carpet and that is what I was looking for. The canister's suction power is not as strong as the upright but the convenience of it is wonderful.,0
"Great vacuum! An excellent purchase as the second vacuum in my home. It is good for all types of floor surfaces. I really like the small handheld vacuum that is included that I can use in my car or on the stairs. I do not have any animals so I cannot speak about pet hair. I do have children who are asthmatics so having a HEPA filter was important to me. It's also good for bedbugs since you must have a disposable bag. It's not quite as good as my Dyson, but for the price it's an excellent vacuum, thus the four stars.",1
"Awesome suction power that completely captured all the dirt that was circulating in my home's carpets for years. Filled up one bag to dispose of. On the downside, the motor failed after 1.5 years of owning it. Its a good thing Hoover backs the product with a 6 year warranty. The authorized service dealer said Hoover will often times just send a new one instead of repairing the motor which takes more time. I hope this will be the case.",1
"This upright vaccum does all it claims to do. The only downfall to the upright is it does not have an ajustable leveler for shag then floor. I love the light on when bag is full. However, the canister vaccum does not have this feature. However, it does pick up well on my hard surfaces.",1
"lve this item , very light weight , easy to use , dust free , cleans very well ..just one problem bags are very hard too find .",1
"My housekeeper is very happy with both units. I'm not so happy using it on my VERY high cut pile 8 x 12 area rug. I have a difficult time moving the vac and find that I have to drag it rather than moving it backwards and forwards. On the lower setting it handles smaller area rugs very well. The cannister unit works well on all my wooden shutters, wood walls, popcorn ceilings, and fan blades. Not so good on the upholstery. Short of using duct tape, the wand and accessories don't stay together well. I have been unable to find filters in any retail store however, just found them on this site. They are fairly pricey however, I have no resident family and my dog doesn't shed so they have lasted quite a long time. If I had it to do over, I'd have kept my old upright that self propelled!",1
I actually just bought this product a few hours ago and was excited to try it out. I have never spent this much money before on a vaccum. I can't help but be concerned about this vaccum lasting. I vaccumed my daughters room and was impressed and then I used the canister for the stairs and was really smiling from ear to ear. But I still am leary about this vaccum. Because of it's high tech technology. I did notice that when I was vaccuming my daughters room it shut off and I had to unplug it to turn it back on. So I am not so sure yet!,1
"I have been very pleased with my past windtunnel vaccuums, I figured I couldn't go wrong, but I would never have bought it if I had known how hard it would be to find replacement bags for it. The suction is very good and it's so light and the head is very compact, making it really easy to use on stairs except that it has no hoses to clean the very back of the step. I have to get out 2 vaccuums to get the job done.",1
I wanted a simple upright that wouldn't clog easily. Also prefer the bags to bagless to reduce dust. The canister was a special bonus and both are so lightweight and easy to put together and use. Very satisfied.,1
"The Bad such as it is, is that the Porta Power canister vac hasn't had much visible evolution over the years, other than to get rid of the gaskets inside the end of the wand. (Actually, that's a big plus! - I used to have a commercial Porta Power and that gasket gave me fits.) Now for the Good. No more getting dust in the face when emptying the vacuum cleaner. I used to have a Dyson Animal, and while not needing bags was nice, it was all but impossible to not get a cloud of dust when emptying it. Two other big pluses over the Dyson are that the Platinum's head is thinner, so I can get further under funiture, and by switching to low suction, I can do area rugs that were completely impossible with the Dyson.",1
"Have had Hoovers for the past 20 years. Went looking for a new vacuum and came upon the Platinum. It's wonderful but I would like to be able to unwind the cord easier, the hook where you wind the cord should rotate making the cord slid off, I had that feature on my old Hoover. other wise so far its been great.",1
"I purchased this product based on two things. I wanted to get away from bagless and I wanted to buy a quality vac. I was so tired of vaccuming up a huge pile of junk and then having to empty it out and then clean out the filter. I think all the dirt that I had just sucked up went right back into the air and into my house! I know that bags cost money but it does not compare to the frustration I feel when I am emptying a bagless. There weren't that many bagged vaccums to choose from in the stores but I am positive that I made the right choice. The Hoover did cost more than I had planned to spend but, I got the quality I hoped for. My carpets looked fantastic after just one cleaning! The sleek old-school style and windtunnel purring of the motor was another plus. You get what you pay for, right.",1
"Works great, technologically friendly, stylish, lightweight, easy to store, great purchase even though expensive. The canister is excellent too but noisy as heck - you need earplugs ! but it works well too, although the main attachment head kept falling off.",1
"I bought this vacuum because it is lightweight and bagged. I love it. Totally. But the included cannister has serious issues: the floor brush won't stay on the wand without duct tape(!) the upholstry brush is useless--very small and the dusting brush is non-existent (some strange thing you fit onto the upholstry brush). What was Hoover thinking I still have to use my old cannister vacuum to handle upholstry, stairs and furniture dusting. What a disappointment.",1
"I use on my carpets, stairs and furniture. I like that it is light weight but I realy miss the retractable power cord. The part of vacuuming I dislike the most is winding up the power cord.",1
"Very good vacuum. After going through 1 vacuum every 18 mos, we decided to go to a simple design (less to break). The gimmicke vacuums seem to be cheaply made, and lose suction after 6 mos or so.",0
Very light weight.Works better than any bagless vacuum,0
"I have always had bagless uprights, and never really was satisfied with any of them. I LOVE this vacuum. Each time I vacuum it fluffs the carpet a little bit more, and this carpet is well worn in the high traffic areas. I had just vacuumed with the old vacuum right before buying this one. I immediately had to take it for a test drive once we got it home. The old vacuum had left so much behind that by the time I got done I had to change the bag. For those that give low ratings because they can't find the bag...I have found the bags at other stores. Since that intial use with the vacuum...I haven't had to change the bag again. So they must last quite a while once they pick up everything the old vac left behind!",0
"I just read some reviews about the handle breaking on these vacuums and I wonder if people are lifting their vacuum and carrying it around incorrectly. There is a carry handle on the vacuum and it should only be lifted with that. I always lift my Hoover via its carry handle, not the handle used when operating the machine, and after owning this Hoover for several years now I have to say it has never given me any grief. It is lightweight and easy to use and the only thing I have to do occasionally is adjust the bag when the red warning light comes on notifying me that the bag is full when in reality, it isn't. Sometimes this happens within a couple days of installing a new bag so I know it cannot possibly need changing. I figured out what was happening and it is cat hair clogging the upper part of the bag. If I have a lot of cat hair to clean up this can happen because the hair does not fall to the bottom of the bag like normal weight debris will...instead, it gets sucked into the bag and stays right there at the top and after a few days of that happening, the change bag warning light comes on because the cat hair stuck at the top of the bag makes the machine think the bag is full. The little canister cleaner is not quite as wonderful as the upright--it's actually quite basic--but it comes in handy for cleaning out the car.",1
"...and for two good reasons! Our previous vacuum cleaner, the exact same model's 'mother board' needed to be repaired among other things (chipped under plate- most certain cleaning crew did not take care of the vac). Back to the 2 reasons... 1) HEPA bags. HEPA bags trap dust and pollen, so I haven't had allergy attacks as often as I used to have. 2) Removes more dirt EFFICIENTLY!! There's a a sturdy row of brushes on either sides that pick up dirt. The suction power is unbelievable, I could feel my very thick carpet rise a bit as I vacuum.",1
"I never write a review for products, but I could not pass up on this product (this should say A LOT to Hoover). I have had this vacuum for 2 weeks now and LOVE it. I purchased a Dyson Animal Canister 1st, and HATED it, so I returned it (the reviews stated this was the best). I then purchased a LG Kompressor Canister and it almost caught on fire the first time I used it..and it did a poor job cleaning. I then decided on the Hoover Platinum upright. The 3rd time was a charm. This has to be the best vacuum I have purchased in many years. It has cut my cleaning time in half. The only suggestion would be to offer a rotating pet brush for the stairs and furniture for the canister portion of this. GREAT JOB HOOVER for making a quality product. You now have won me over for life.",1
"Easy to use, my rugs look great ! Wonderful on floors too !",1
"I have always had Hoovers and loved them (since 1970) I bought a bagless Bissell and when I saw this Wind Tunnel, I fell in love. My only problem was the recent problem with finding bags. You can have your Dysons etc. I am a happy woman!!",1
"Great vacuum. Picked it because I wanted a separate canister system with all the attachments. This thing does not dissappoint. Super smooth and easy to use. Great looking product and with the Hoover name, it should last me for many years!",1
It is wonderful. easy to use and great for dog hair! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
was looking around for a bagged vacuum. Read several reviews and decided to try it out. once i got it home I got it home I was very impressed how light weight it was. I really enjoy the seperate vacuum for stairs and what have you.,1
"Was considering an Oreck at twice the cost until I read the reviews on this Hoover. It is basically identical to the Oreck, just less money. So far it is a fantastic vacuum cleaner, much better than the older Hoover upright I have.",1
I bought this after my granddaughter got one. She loved hers so much I had to try it. It is light weight and powerful. The separate canister is perfect to carry room to room and vacuum hardwood and tile floors.,1
"I couldn't believe the change in appearance of the carpet after one vacuuming with this cleaner! It was obviously so much better than with an older Hoover upright. The cleaner is pleasantly lightweight, but does a wonderful job.",1
"Overall, this is a terrific vacuum. The person who will be happiest with this combination is the person who: (1) wants a lightweight vacuum, (2) has mostly carpet in their home, (3) has carpeted stairs, and (4) uses attachments.",1
"Works as described. Comes with a bonus -- a standalone small canister vacuum with hose attachments. Both the upright and canister vacuums have HEPA filters, which is great, because I have severe allergies. Both work very well.",1
"This is a great vacuum. I love how it has the separate canister for doing floors and is lightweight. I actually prefer this to the bag less because it is much less work to empty. Does great on pet hair, great price at walmart.",1
"It's very convenient to have one for hard surfices with attachments for cleaning drapes, sofas, etc. and another powerful, no adjustments necessary for carpet rugs. Both are light weight, easy to use and powerful cleaners!",1
We have had this vacuum for about 5 years and lover it. The handle broke and Hoover sent a new machine even though we did not have our original receipt. Great support Hoover!,1
"I've only had this product for a few weeks, but it seems to do everything I hoped that it would do. I selected this vac after a good deal of research - best by far for the money. Walmart definitely gave me the best deal.",1
"I wanted a bagged vacuum that was lightweight without compromising on features or breaking the bank. I did a lot of research and found this Hoover upright with separate canister. I liked the idea of a separate canister that I could pull out for little jobs or for vacuuming the car. I already own a (heavy) Hoover upright with all tools on board. My style of vacuuming is to grab the hose extender and tools to do those jobs as I go along - alternating between floor vacuuming and dusting. So, the new vacuum means that I have to change my habit - a minor concession that I am happy to make. I like this vacuum. It really is lightweight with controls right where you expect them. I like having the headlight (something you do not get with inexpensive and/or lightweight vacuums). Both the upright and the canister have lots of suction. I noticed right away that debris within a couple of inches of the nozzle was sucked right in. That told me that anything under the head was getting totally sucked in. The canister gives me so much freedom that I forget that it is wired and eventually I get out of range of the cord length and get pulled back to reality (it has a long electrical cord). Overall, for my money, this was a very good purchase. I don't like to vacuum but this vacuum makes the job easy. So that I don't leave anything out, here is a list of things I like about this vacuum: Lightweight Big debris bag Serious suction Long cord on both units Headlight Only as noisy as necessary Separate Canister for dusting or small jobs Intuitive control placements (on/off switch, tilt pedal) Well-placed handles Upright unit will lie down flat for vacuuming stairs and under furniture Easy to maneuver Narrow nozzle allows cleaning in tight spaces Full bag indicator (I have not seen this)",1
"This vacuum is lightweight, easy to turn, and has exceptional suction even on the low setting. The separate canister and attachments are great especially for cleaning the car and dusting blinds.",1
We have had this model for several years and find it to be a great machine. Does a great job and the extra mobile canister is great. Would definitely buy again.,1
I bought this vac 3 years ago. Somehow it developed a short somewhere. I called them and they shipped me a new vac free of charge. They are the best!!! I will always by a Hoover.,1
"This vacuum performs well above the competitors, and with a limited six year warranty...you can't beat it. The canister is also an excellent for cleaning those hard to reach areas and stairs.",1
"I love this vacuum. The suction power is awesome. I have 4 kids, 2 cats, and 2 dogs. The platinum cleans up beautifully after them all- hair, dirt, and who knows what else. Thank you Hoover!",1
Very pleased with this vacuum cleaner! It picks up the smallest lint that our previous vacuum just rolled over and over. I'm done in a fraction of the time it used to take. Highly recommend.,1
"I Love this unit! It runs great! The reviews were correct, except the can't find bags prob. Not a prob anymore!",1
Love the vacuum. Good suction and like the handheld that comes with it. Necessary for corners. Have not used it so long but even husband remarks on lightness and quietness of this product.,1
PRICE GREAT. PERFORMANCE terrific. So glad I bought the Hoover Platinum Collection with canister. Canister is powerful. Upright performances is perfect. So so glad I bought it!!!!!,1
I love my new vaccuum so does our housekeeper! So light great pick-up. My husband and I didn't know that are carpet was that white! Special features for stairs. Highly recommend!,1
I love how lightweight this vacuum is. It is easy to carry up the steps to vacuum the upstairs. It also has great suction. The small canister vacuum is useful for detail cleaning.,1
"I'm very please with both vacuums, they sure do a great job on my tile floors and rugs picking up our sheltie dog a few inches away from the vacuum cleaners.",1
The main unit is powerful and lightweight and the portable unit is tremendously useful everywhere! A great value for the money!!,1
"We have hardwood floor, carpet, carpeted stairs and tile and wanted a lightweight vacuum cleaner that could be used everywhere. This Hoover does it all and with minimal effort!",1
"Great power, light weight, stylish. We haven't used the canister that came with it yet but the upright is awesome, sucks up the dog hair like you wouldn't believe. LOVE IT!!!",1
"The Hoover Platinum vac IS lightweight very easy to handle, it has excellent suction with automatic floor level adjustment (from rugs to bare floor) and the hand vac that comes with it works just as good. We vacuumed my husband's truck after taking the 3 dogs to the vets! Didn't leave a single hair!!",1
I purchased six years ago and for a 82 year old person with wall to wall carpets plus stairs this upright is easy to handle and so easy to change bags. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"I have had the Platinum for years now. The Canister and Upright made strong, built to last. Both the canister and upright are extremely easy to maneuver when cleaning. Love the quality of the the Hepa filter bags too. The vacuums are never dusty or dirty-that's the best feature of this product!",1
"The Hoover Platinum Collection is a great product. I am very happy with how the upright vacuum works, and also pleased with the vacuum attachment/tools. My carpet looks great after cleaning, and both machines are lightweight and easy to operate. I am happy with the price and the quick delivery.",1
I have owned this vacuum for 8 years and absolutely love it. It is lightweight. Making it easy to take up and down stairs. I have a long haired dog and 3 cats and it does a good job picking up hair on the carpet and the wood/laminate floors. I will purchase this model again.,1
"If you are looking for a lightweight,efficient vacuum that actually picks up dirt, this is the one. I've had all different kinds over the years and was tired of fighting to push an upright and lug it up the stairs and thought the canisters were clumsy. This Hoover is the best of both worlds.",1
"We have two dogs so we were looking for something that would pick up dog hair. This vacuum cleaner seams to do it all. The small vacuum really comes in handy for upholstery, lamp shades, and small jobs. The large vacuum is slightly heavier than I like but the performance makes up for it.",1
This is a great vacuum. I have had it about 2 weeks and love it. Easy to use.One postive is that you get 2 vacuums for the price of one (the upright and small canister). Love the canister with all of the attachments too. I will NEVER go back to a bagless vacuum again. They are too messy.,1
"Got ours when they were introduced a number of years ago....durable as I expect from Hoover...lightweight, powerful cleaning This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
The Hoover Platinum Bagged Upright Vacuum is an excellent vacuum. The two major things I like about it is that it is very light in weight and it has a Hepa bag that keeps the dusk from blowing back on the carpet or surrounding area. It is easy to manuver and cleans good. It comes with an unattached product that has attachments that clean upholstery etc.,1
I bought the bagged upright with canister in 12/ 07/13. Love it. Will never go back to a bagless vacuum. They are disgusting to clean and all the junk you breathe when dumping it,1
"I love how light it is and it does a great job on the carpet. Also, the small canister vacuum is so nice and light I am able to vacuum the ceiling and walls each week now with very little effort. The attachments are great. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Shopped around for a vacuum that could handle picking up our dog's hair - and everything else that three kids add to that. This one works wonders! I did a fair amount of research this one rated 1 on Consumer Reports and I think they got it right. The price at Walmart was way below other sellers, too. Look no further if you want a fantastic vacuum!",1
"I was looking for a quality vacuum that was lightweight. This one got excellent reviews so I bought it. It is powerful, lightweight, easy to assemble, easy to use and the bags (to upright and the portable) and easily accessible. The cords are nice and long, too. I am very happy with this purchase.",1
This is my third Hoover vacuum and so far I love it. I can go from my carpet to hardwood flooring to oriental rugs and it automatically adjusts and does a good job cleaning at all levels. The on/off switch is on the handle and sometimes I accidentally turn the vac off when directing it around an obstacle but I think I'll get used to that with time.,1
"Excellent vacuum. Great suction, great features. I love the portable canister that comes with the upright model. Very handy. Two vacuums come in this platinum product: the upright which is absolutely fabulous on carpets, and the shoulder-carried canister which makes short work of our tile and hardwood floors. Excellent product and very good value.",1
"I love the fact that it's very lightweight. I use it throughout the house on my carpets, floors and tile. It is exceptionally great for stairs. I've always used a Hoover, but this is by far the best of the best. I've only had it a few weeks, but love it. The only thing I would change is to have the attachments on the vacuum instead of separate.",1
"I spent months looking for a vacuum. I have purchased, used, and returned almost every single vacuum out there. 2 Sharks, Dyson, Eureka, Target hoover, and Bissell. This vacuum is honestly a joy to use and I can tell by the quality it will last a lifetime. Seriously, try one. (I have 2 dogs, a husky and a lab).",1
"Very pleased with the Hoover Platinum vacuum. Easy to use, quiet and works great. The side portable vacuum is nice also. Great for the car. My only wish is that the upright had a hose to get corners, etc., so I could do all the vacuuming at once. But that being said, the portable works well also and has a shoulder strap which is convenient.",1
Very light-weight (I can carry it with one hand). It still sounds like a vacuum cleaner but is much quieter than my old Hoover. I use the canister cleaner and attachments on my carpeted stairs with very good results. I like the sleek look of the vacuum and I like that the front that holds the bag is made of cloth and not hard plastic.,1
"I've had this vacuum for a couple of years, and it still works great. Someone at Bed Bath Beyond recommended this vacuum and I'm glad I listened. I looked this up to copy the info for a friend and just had to write a review saying how satisfied I am with it. It hasn't lost suction and it picks up well on carpet and wood floors equally.",1
"I just got my vacuum a couple of weeks ago, and I really like it so far. Before I bought the Hoover, I had looked at the Oreck. The Hoover had basically the same features for half the price. Also, consumer reports rated this vacuum the highest in its class and the customer reviews were good also. So far, I believe I made a good choice.",1
we bought this vacuum for my grandmother who has a bad shoulder and needed a lightweight vacuum. we where not going to pay the price that oreck wanted for their light weight vacuums so we bought this one she loves is her house smells fresher since buying this vaccum the carpets look grate and best of all her shoulders no longer hurt,1
I bought this when it was first introduced. I love it's power and so easy to use. The bag replacement is a cinch and no belts to change. Cleans my carpets and floors thoroughly. Will buy again. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"This vacuum cleaner was highly rated in consumer reports and now I know why. Set up out of the box was quick and intuituve. It also came with a smaller cleaner as a bonus. The vacuum works like a charm. The kids beat up the carpet pretty good and I though it would never get clean, but this badboy really picks up well. You can see and feel the suction, the carpet looks great. It hugs the corners and has an power hi low option that I have never seen before. Also it has a light indicator to let you now when the bag is full. Awesome purchase. I was a bit hestitant in buying it because of the high dollar amount but if it keeps working as if is now for some years it will be worth every penny.",1
This is my first Hoover. I love that its lightweight so easy to push around my carpet and furniture. It was easy to set up and works like a dream. I love my new Hoover. The wind tunnel technology is amazing. I love the Hepa bags and now know that my house will be free of dust and allergens. Great suction and brush fluffed up my matted carpet. My 5 year old Kenmore recently died and I replaced it with this Hoover. I'm not disappoined. I'm very happy that I did. My Kenmore weighed a ton and was bulky. Hand held canister is great on corners and tile floors. Also great to clean around my air conditioning vents and dryer lint catcher area. I am very satisfied with this vacuume. Great product.,1
Very light and strong. Wish we bought it earlier.,0
"This sweeper is the best I've ever owned! I received it today and it took me less than 5 minutes to assemble it. It really does the job well and the suction is tremendous. It's very lightweight for someone like me who is only 5'2. The cannister that is included is also wonderful. Although my little dog was scared of the motor, I don't think it's overly loud. Although some might think the replacement bags are expensive at 5, remember, they aren't regular bags they are HEPA bags. This sweeper makes me want to run it every day, it's so much fun! I really can't find fault with it. The instruction booklets are written so that you can clearly understand them. What an excellent product!",1
"I just read some reviews about the handle breaking on these vacuums and I wonder if people are lifting their vacuum and carrying it around incorrectly. There is a carry handle on the vacuum and it should only be lifted with that. I always lift my Hoover via its carry handle, not the handle used when operating the machine, and after owning this Hoover for several years now I have to say it has never given me any grief. It is lightweight and easy to use and the only thing I have to do occasionally is adjust the bag when the red warning light comes on notifying me that the bag is full when in reality, it isn't. Sometimes this happens within a couple days of installing a new bag so I know it cannot possibly need changing. I figured out what was happening and it is cat hair clogging the upper part of the bag. If I have a lot of cat hair to clean up this can happen because the hair does not fall to the bottom of the bag like normal weight debris will...instead, it gets sucked into the bag and stays right there at the top and after a few days of that happening, the change bag warning light comes on because the cat hair stuck at the top of the bag makes the machine think the bag is full. The little canister cleaner is not quite as wonderful as the upright--it's actually quite basic--but it comes in handy for cleaning out the car.",1
"I LOVE THIS VACUUM! I can't believe I have been using my old piece of junk for all these years! This is a great vacuum. It makes my carpet look so nice. In fact, after vacuuming, the door that goes from the house to the garage that has the self close hinges on it, doesn't close by itself anymore because the carpet is standing up too high! That's fine with me! I don't think the main vacuum is loud at all. It's even a little more quiet than my old one. The little canister that comes with it works good. It's a little loud but I don't care. I'm only using it a short time. It doesn't matter if it's loud for a few minutes. You can't go wrong with this vacuum. It's great!",1
"I can't speak to durability as I just purchased it, but I'm in heaven! Our other upright was 10 years old so I know that many vacuums would have made me happy. This one is SO light, has Great suction (it lifted my very heavy dining room rug off the floor), and almost drives itself. I bought it mostly just to use upstairs as we have heavy carpet and two long-haired pets, as well as a toddler. It definitly makes me feel like that carpet is finally clean of dust and hair. Our sniffles and sneezes every morning have stopped, and I'm sure this vacuum is the reason. It's rated 2 by Consumer Reports, don't waste your money on others. And Walmart had by far the best price.",1
"It's easy to use and powerful enough to keep my wool carpets clean, trust me that says alot. We have kids coming and going all day as well as three dogs. This vacuum is wonderful and certainly has made the daily chore a vacuuming a cinch. Carpet looks beautiful. As for the small cannister vac Excellent! It's so easy to sling on a shoulder and walk around cleaning. I do have 12 foot ceiling though and am only 5'5, so I wish there was one extra hose extender included, but I get my taller son to reach up high and he has no issue. Others have complained about noise....I can't agree, or I simply don't find it an issue. No complaints here and I do vacuum alot!",1
"i live with two 80 year olds. this upright vacuum is light enough for my mom to easily carry upstairs and down. the first time she used it, she ended up vacuuming the entire house. she had not planned to, but said it was so lightweight, she did not tire pushing it around. and i personally love the lightweight canister vac. i take it to and from work to vacuum my office i use it in my studio, the laundry room, the stairs, etc. it too is so lightweight it is easy to carry to and fro. both the upright and canister are powerful but simple. my mother is not one to like complicated contraptions, so this vacuum was a wonderful find. i cannot recommend it enough.",1
"Have only had it for a month so I can't attest to its long-term durability, but so far this Hoover Platinum Bagged Upright is super. Cool retro look, comfortable handle, lighter weight than my cat, and, most importantly, great suction (edge, too). Works well on carpet and hardwood. Very maneuverable. The canister vac that comes with it is also nifty. Am still getting used to slinging it over my shoulder. In that position it is closer to your head and therefore quite loud, but not outrageously. I really like the idea of selling these 2 as a combo. Fitting attachments to an upright's hose can be so annoying. This upright is not trying to be a canister.",1
"We bought our Platinum Upright 2 years ago and we love it. We had bought a fancy new upright canister vacuum before that and it was heavy and always getting plugged up in one of many locations. This Vacuum is light weight and powerful. If you turn it on and let go of the handle, its so powerful that it will take off moving on its own. The portable unit that comes with it is handy and powerful as well. As long as we can get bags and parts to keep this vacuum running, it will always be cleaning our home. The only complaint I have is that the store we bought it at no longer carries it or the bags, so we have to order them from Hoover. GREAT JOB HOOVER!",1
"Scenario: three story house with a variety of floor coverings from hardwood and ceramic to wall-to-wall carpet. Required: an upright with a headlight, HEPA bags and no extra attachments or hoses - just give me a vacuum that cleans carpets well. Have a nice little canister vac for smooth floors. To be avoided: Canister vacs with carpet attachments and uprights with floor attachment. All horrible machines, they do nothing well. And bag-less Whoever thought up that idea needs a brain check. What a mess to empty and then all the filters to wash or replace....who needs it This vacuum was exactly what I wanted: light-weight, had a headlight and used HEPA bags. I shopped like crazy and nothing else seemed to fit the bill. Even though I didn't need the extra canister vac I decided to go ahead and buy the combo. Review: The upright is amazing: long enough cord, easy to carry up and down stairs, fingertip controls. It cleans carpets exceptionally well. And it looks pretty fabulous too, a bit like a butler in a tux. (I can dream can't I) The surprise extra was the little canister, it's a blast to use! No bashing walls and flipping over. It also uses HEPA bags. Another well-mannered machine that performs above and beyond the expected! If you have a variety of floor coverings and live in a multi-level house these are your dream machines!!!",1
"Title says it all. We're tired of struggling with the heavy central vac hose in our house, so we decided to try this Hoover based on the positive reviews. We unpacked our new Hoover this morning and my husband spent the day cleaning every nook and cranny he could find. It's light enough to easily carry around all three floors, transitions seamlessly from the hardwood to the carpets, and is very powerful. My husband is especially in love with the portable cannister he used the attachments to dust in every hard to reach corner he could think of. It seems sturdily built and well designed and hopefully will last a long time.",1
"I've used this vacuum now 3-4 times a day in our kitchen, cleaning up after toddlers at every meal. The hand-held portion works very well. We've had a problem with the floor brush falling off several times, but we just stick it back on and continue. I wish it stayed on better, but it's not a huge inconvenience. I love that it picks up wet food - bits of cheese, scrambled egg, green beans etc. The upright portion of this vacuum has good suction. It is a bit hard to push. Loudness is all relative, I know. I think it is a bit quieter than our last vacuum, but still fairly loud. I wish that both portions had a bag-full indicator. I also wish the bags weren't as expensive as they are, nor as hard to find. Overall, a good set of vacuums.",1
"All the features I disliked about my other two vacuums (both sold as commercial models from two different manufacturers)power cord too short, plastic parts that failed to hold attachments, difficult adjustment lever for different floor surfaces, to name a fewhave been addressed and improved with this model. I truly love it. It is compact in design but very well made--it reminds me of the older models that were built to last. It is lighter than my other two vacuums which really makes a difference when carrying it to the second floor. It does an outstanding job on pet hair, stairs, and my multi-surfaced floors automatically. I love it! I am so confident that I disposed of my other two models. I know this new Hoover can handle it all.",1
"We have had this hoover for 7 years. We have 4 kids and an in-law. We have had 2 dogs (labradors), and 2 cats. We track more dirt into the house then the local public library. That said, this vacuum has been a work horse. Its kept pace with our neck-breaking, dirt making capabilities. Its seen 4 household moves, has tumbled down a few flights of stairs, and has battled with tinsel, extension chords, and a few hundred barrettes! Its kept our 4300 SQFT house as clean as could be expected. Any negatives Some would view the bag as a negative, but I really feel as though it contains the dirt best and no messy canister clean out. The little vacuum is great as well for baseboards, and stairs....little suck packs a punch. Id buy it again.",1
"I cleaned houses through college and have used every vacuum at every price point out there and I would choose this vacuum every time! (Even over a Dyson and similar high-end brands)! The pick-up is great and consistent, while not being extremely loud. The upright is light and easy to use, and the canister is light and is easy to throw over your shoulder and get those pesky hard to reach places. Without fail I would choose this Hoover every time.",1
"I love this vacuum! It is wonderful and does a great job - especially for those with allergies! It works well on pet fur, dirt and sand up. I have been professionally cleaning houses for ten years and have used a wide variety of different makes and models or all levels and qualities - including uprights and pull-behinds, oreks, hoovers, electrolux, etc etc. THIS COMPARES VERY HIGHLY to the Orek which is three times the price. The little hand-held buddy as separate unit is easier to use than having an upright with a detachable hose (which never quite gives as much suction when it is constantly removed, reattached, removed, reattached, and so on - it just isn't a tight seal. This upright is easy to manuver and is smart enough to do varying levels (no need to stop and readjust the floor level) and can do hard floor surfaces just as well as carpets. It has not once scratched a wood floor or laminate and I tend to run through the entire hose with the upright and only use the hand-vac for edges and corners. The little hand-held is like a souped-up dust-buster! Unfortunately it has a very loud high pitched noise while running, but I think the great suction is the pay-off. Also I wish the little hand-held had the same light feature that the upright has. It helps you see cob-webs that would've otherwise been missed. Being honest, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MODEL - and the only downfalls I can see are expensive HEPA filter replacement bags (but therein you are getting all pollens, dust, mold spores, etc that would've been left behind otherwise) AND the bottom of the upright unit needs to unscrewed and cleaned out regularly. This is common on any beater-bar when things wrap around it, however I notice that this model gets pet fur clogged up the air-shaft more than some others. It is easy to fix (just 5 or 10 minutes once a month or every other) to unscrew four screws - clean it out well - and replace screws. They walk you through it on the hoover support line if you need help. This helps if the check bag light comes on even though its a fairly new bag you know its not really full. Like I said, I own a cleaning business, so I have recommended this to at least a dozen customers who were due for new vacuums and all have been equally happy with price and quality.",0
I bought one about 2 years ago love it... especially like the fact that it has a bag versus a canister filter just bought a second one to use upstairs!,1
We had a kirby for many years before it passed. We decided to get a lighter vacume since we are older. We purchased a Oreck not a good purchase would not suck up even a ladybug off tile real unhappy. So we decided to see what Consumer Reports said low and behold they recomended the Hoover Platinum for weight and power and they were correct. We have only had ours for about three weeks and it has been great. Only problem we have heard of is getting bags so we did order extras and are still waiting for them.,0
"WOW! I got mine from ... today and all I can say is WOW! Hoover you out did yourselves! After using a disgusting, clunky, poorly designed bagless Bissell, this is the most amazing vacuum I have ever used! My living room rug is an entire shade lighter! I don't feel like I need a shower after vacuuming now. I works beautifully on the stairs, no hoses needed. It picked up every crumb. I only had to change outlets once and I have a 2200 sqft quad level home! I have two small children, 1 dog 2 cats and it picked up everything! Assembled in minutes with one screw. Need to get used to the on/off switch b/c I keep hitting it when I vacuum...but definitely not a deal breaker! Love, love, love this vacuum!",1
I have owned this Hoover Platinum upright for over 6 years now and it is simply the best vacuum I have ever owned. You can maneuver it very easily due to it being lightweight. The suction power on this vac is unbelievable and really cleans my rugs and floors great. I have a yellow lab that sheds so I choose to own a vacuum with bag so this can be tossed out. Great job Hoover for providing an excellent quality machine.,1
"We have used the Hoover Platinum Collection Lightweight Bagged Upright Vacuum UH30010COM and the portable canister unit SH10000 that comes with it for about 10 days. We are very pleased with the ordering process, the price (212.00 + 0.97 shipping + 12.24 sales tax, a total of 225.21) and so far the 2 vacuums. So far, both the upright and the portable canister have performed admirably. The upright is powerful yet light, around 12 pounds the lightness is important because we have 40 steps to carry it up and down. The upright also cleans the edge of a wall-to-wall carpet all the way to where it meets the baseboard - something no other vacuum I have owned has been able to do, a terrific feature. The portable canister is handy for cleaning less accessible places that are awkward for the upright (e.g., around windows, sliding door tracks, under the refrigerator). You can use the upright to clean carpeted stairs if your wish - the handle folds down 90 degrees so it is even with the stair treads and there is a convenient handle on the body of the upright that helps you in cleaning stairs. This is OK for me, but still too heavy for my wife, so she uses the portable canister for the stairs. Assuming no long-term maintenance problems, I could not be more pleased with my purchase.",1
"Best vacuum I have ever had. Its lightweight and I can go from carpet to wood floor and it glides along so easily. It has great suction and it is a pleasure to vacuum with. The cylinder is like manna from heaven for me. I can do the stairs in minutes and the edges (my home has never been so dust free) the suction on this unit is great too...good for the car as well. Very easy to put together when it arrived. On the negative the bags are a little spendy (but i went online and bought 4 bags, 2 for the vacuum and 2 for the cylinder for 23 bucks incl shipping). Thinking they are going to last easily a year even though i have 2 kids and 2 cats! Great product from Hoover!! Great price from Walmart!!",1
"The Hoover Platinum Collection combination is a great lightweight combination that covers all your vacuum needs for the home, car, etc., I have purchased 3 of these sets and have nothing but positive reviews for this product they are powerful lightweight products that are priced at a decent and fair price. I had to replace the hose on the canister vacuum because my family had used it and actually wore it out! I had it for 7+ years. I would highly recommend purchasing this collection, combination.",1
"Hoover out-did itself with THIS PRODUCT. WOW...I'M IMPRESSED and perfectly happy with my purchase. The upright canister is everything and more with suction. Pulls itself along on low carpeting and is very lightweight. The tag-along canister vac for the stairs and bare floors is TOTALLY AWESOME...!! With the wand extension, there's NO bending over. It glides along the floor and cleans under things just perfectly. With all the tools attached, theres' no stopping. I'm thrilled with my purchase. THANK YOU HOOVER FOR MAKING MY LIFE EASIER...!!!",1
"I have a Dirt Devil Reaction Vacuum that me and my wife hated for a while. So we decided to buy this vacuum as a replacement. Wow!, what a difference! When I first turned the vacuum on, you could literally feel and see the suction this thing had. When i got done vacuuming, our carpet looked like when we first had it. I t really lifted the fibers. I have a dog and I didn't smell any of the exhaust or dog smell everything smell good. The front light is nice and bright. The vacuum also is not to heavy especially compared to my old one. Overall to me this is a great vacuum so far. The small vacuum is also pretty good. Good suction, plenty of accessories, same style of vacuum bag. The only thing I would say it's that it was a little heavy. but no biggie because it had a shoulder strap. Overall a good deal.",1
We got this vacuum when our bissel died. It is very light weight like advertised and the suction is really strong. The lights on it are real bright also. The only down side to it is that you can't turn off the roller for hard woods. But I'm real happy with it. The high and low power settings are great for area rugs. The other hand held vac is really strong and it comes with some really useful attachments. For the price you can't beat it. I've used an orieck that my inlaws have and this is just as good or better. Also I've used a dyson and I really can't tell the difference in what they pull up. It's half the cost and half the weight of the dyson and comes with the small hand held vac. Also the finger control is really a nice touch. I am impressed with it. It's well worth the money.,1
"I have bought many vacuums over the years even owned a couple of Hoovers but my last vacuum was a Kenmore needed replacing at 3 yrs old so I started to do some research since I knew I didn't want another Kenmore.. I knew I definitely wanted an upright one with a bag I had owned a vacuum that was a bagless type but found it to have little suction power.. I looked at the comments for this Hoover Platinum on Amazon, Target Walmart liked what I read liked the price here at Walmart so I bit the bullet bought it using the 'Site to Store' perk to waive the shipping fees.. Well as someone that owns a pet I can tell you I LOVE THIS VACUUM it is light easy to move around boy does it pick things up.. I was also surprised that when I vacuumed over the marks in the carpet left by furniture chairs the marks came right up like they were never there.. What also surprised me was how you really can vacuum over scatter rugs with it the vacuum doesn't eat the scatter rug up like they usually do here I thought it was just words again in the instruction booklet.. I would recommend this vacuum to everyone the additional attachment vacuum is easy to handle use too.. Worth the price ..",1
It does a great job of getting dirt from my rugs. Light weight and easy to manipulate around furniture. The price is very reasonable. I found the small canister to be easy to use and efficient to use on the car mats.,0
This product sucks in a good way! Easy to use for my wife who suffered tendonitis after the birth of our son it is also reasonably noisy/quiet so our son isn't awakened when used in the same room.,0
"I find the Hoover Platinum bagged vacuum to be a nice combination (upright plus hand-carry). As many others have said, the upright is very light compared to my old Hoover upright Windtunnel. It is much quieter, particularly over plush carpet, and the two handles work well to guide the upright for carpeted stair cleaning. I was surprised at how well the upright fluffed up our plush carpets, particularly on stairs (makes them look like new). The rubber wheels roll quietly on hard floors, and don't mark. The hand-held vacuum is also light and easy to carry. Contrary to some reviewers, I did not find it particularly loud and the vacuum strength is adequate for cleaning corners and upholstery. One gripe is that there is no height adjustment on the upright, which makes it hard to push on plush rugs (very easy on hard floors and berber carpets). To counter this, I run the upright on low to reduce the vacuum strength which in turn makes pushing the vacuum easier. Gripe two is that the beater brush does not stop spinning when the upright is in the locked, upright position. I don't use the upright on hardwood floors, so this is not a big issue for me. (The hand-held vacuum cleans hard floors pretty well).",1
"purchased this a few weeks ago and I love it. It's light weight, bagged and quieter than all my other previous vacuums.",0
Has super suction and lightweight. I just had it about two weeks now so far I absolutely love it.,0
"This is lightweight but very powerful. The HEPA collection must truly 99+ percent because its not all dusty like previous vacuums. The vacuum itself is clean. I love how it moves. Cleans so well, can hear it and see. I also like the light in front, the brushes on the side that help with corners. I also like the high/low setting. And the canister that comes with is super handy too. It's my favorite all time vacuum. My kids know to treat it well.",1
I have been very pleased with this purchase. The vacuum is definitely worth every penny.,0
"I've only owned this product for 4 weeks so consider the Durability rating with a grain of salt. I went to Consumer Reports and checked out other websites ratings and selling of this product. Walmart beat everyone by 100+. Others were selling it for 300+. It's so much quieter than my other Hoover vacuum. It runs smoothly and efficiently. I use it about 2xs per week and have not needed to replace a bag yet. The separate canister for hose and attachments was new to me - it hasn't been cumbersome and I love the fact I can strap across me and zoom around the house for special jobs and my car! My cleaning lady loves this vacuum too. It's so light and easy to carry around and up and down stairs. Thus far, I am very satisfied and Walmart shipped this to me in 2 days.",1
"I purchased this vacuum based on reviews by Consumers Reports. I needed a light weight, durable vacuum. Because this is a 2 piece vacuum system I am not draging around hoses and parts when vacuuming the carpets. I only use the system I need for the job. The small carry around system is perfect for hardwood floors, stairs, dusting, etc. Both are light weight and easy on my back. I have a daughter with extreme allergies and the hepa filters are enclosed and do not put out dust particles. Most important, both parts of this vacuum really clean extremely well. Long cords on both. Main vacuum does not have a quick release lever for the wound cord and the carry vacuum does not have a place to wind the cord. No problem ordering extra bags. You will not be disappointed.",1
This is a great vacuum. It doesn't blow dirt all over. It does the job.,0
"I'm a guy, what can I say.... it works!",1
"Best one we have owned. Quiet, great suction",0
This vacuum is great. Simple and effective.,0
Buy it-great value,0
"This Hoover vacuum is great! It is quiet (for a vacuum), has great suction and is lightweight. It also has a long cord and gets corners and edges pretty well. I did a lot of research before purchasing this vacuum because I have been through 3 other vacuums in the last 9 years. I wanted a lightweight bagged vacuum that had good enough suction to pick up all the hair my dog sheds and could handle both carpet and hardwood floors. Lastly I was looking for something that was not ear-splittingly loud like my old Oreck was! I think my only complaint would be that its profile is about 1/2 inch too high to fit under my kitchen counters. This vacuum has everything I was looking for and I got it for a much lower price at Walmart.com than anywhere else I found it.",1
"I bought this vacuum over two years ago and have been remiss in reviewing it. I came on line today to buy some bags and remembered that I never reviewed this vacuum. Well, I love, love, love it. . It is so lightweight (which is why I bought it) and have not been disappointed. I am a single woman over 59 years old and even I can lift it with ease. I have laminate floors with thick rugs. It works perfect on both. I bought it because it was lightweight but heavy duty. I am so pleased with this vacuum. Never had a problem with it and I can highly recommend it. Well worth the money. I recommend it to friends all the time and would buy another one if I ever needed it. So pleased, even two years later! P.S. I also have a dog -- picks up the hair beautifully!",1
"Love the sweeper, compared it to a Oreck. Only problem I have is you can't find bags for it at Walmart.. Inconvenient trying to locate sweeper bags for this model. Hoover site cost me a fortune for 4 bags. Shipping was high 8.50 and the bags are very expensive. So purchasing 4 Sweeper bags plus 4 sweeper bags for the hand model was like 34.00.. Just for bags!!! I do wish I would have went with the ORECK!",0
"For almost two weeks, I've been digging informations/ratings for a good vacuum cleaner which has a reasonable price (not cheap but also not expensive). I guess this is most of the online shoppers are doing before deciding to click the place order now button. I was leaning toward buying a refurbished Dyson but lost confidence because of too much complaints about the quality and the after sales support I've read from online retailer. Decided to buy this product because it was the 1 pick of consumersreport.org as well as the ratings from people who bought. Additionally, the price of Walmart is unbeatable, I paid 189 while hoover is selling it 299. Performance wise, the product really works great. It's lightweight, the suction power is incredible, noise level is tolerable and design is very simple. I agree with one of the feedback that the canister is a little bit noisy but I don't think the it lack the suction power. Overall this is one of my best buy and would highly recommend it.",0
"I am over 60 and was looking for a lighter vacuum than my current Hoover 17lb. upright. This vacuum is about 12lbs. and moves easily forward and the ergo handle is a nice plus. It definitely is a lot lighter and and easier to handle. This vacuum picks up well, but be careful on lighter throw rugs as it will eat them up even on low setting. The canister has nice suction, but the exhaust in back blows hard and can disturb loose items such as papers, magazines, etc. It is also heavy even with the strap. I use my old extension and tools from my previous Hoover for easier pick up and less strain on the back. I have only had it for 2 weeks and the canister works well for the car. This vacuum arrived the day after I ordered it much to my surprise as I choose the free shipping option. Must have been due to the fact I live close to Walmart distribution center. Only time will tell if this is a good purchase. My older hoover upright is about 15 years old and still working well. Definitely recommend.",0
"This is, so far, the best vacuum cleaner I've ever used. It is very lightweight, maneuvers easily, is relatively quiet, and actually CLEANS MY FLOORS. I have two cats, one of which is a long-haired shedding machine. I vacuum every day. This cleaner really does the trick, and effortlessly compared to other machines. It works great on my hardwood and tile, as well, without kicking up clouds of fur. Transitions from hard to textile surfaces smoothly, but watch it on rugs the suction is so powerful it can grab up lighter rugs. The companion hand-held is pretty slick, too. Easy. I use it more than I thought I would. I'll be interested to see how long this sweeper holds up, since it is the 3rd one I've purchased in almost as many years. It seems to have fewer cheesy plastic parts than most sweepers, but my dear husband still has strict orders to keep his appliance-destroying mitts off. If you want to get your floors clean with a lot less effort, get this sweeper.",0
"Both machines get the job done well. Love that both are bagged. HEPA is a plus. I have used bagless for years, and hate the idea of emptying the dirt bin. Having to empty the dirt bin into a trash can by tapping it defeats the purpose of vaccumming the dirt. Don't you think The upright is light enough, but not as light as Oreck. It can goes pretty flat. The cord is really long. The light is very good and helpful. The low setting is already very loud, so I would not go for the high setting. If loud means powerful, then that is what I have to live with. The canister is not cordless, but a plus side is that it will not loose suction because it doesn't depend on the battery level. The cord of the caniter unit is several feet long, so it is long enough to stretch acroos at least half of my living room to get the job done. A bagged canister is hard to find, too. The price is pretty reasonable for a high-end machine. Do not know if they will last years. Have owned them for several weeks, and used them every 2-3 days. All in all, a happy purchase.",0
"I looked at all vacums, electrulux, dyson, and bought the electrulux upright and returned it, it was nice looking that was it, very heavy, then I looked at the dysons, all of them at Best Buy, and then the sales rep showed me this vacum cleaner, it is not like the other plastic Hoovers at all. This vacum cleaner is awesome, Very Lightweight !!! no dust to deal with !! no dirt in your face, you can actually vacum without feeling like you need to take a shower , after playing with your dust cup ! It is very easy to move around, it does a very good job on carpet or tile ! I never thought to even look at it, I am so glad the sales rep showed it to me, I Love It, it has a huge bag, and no dust flying around when you empty it. It even comes with a second vacum, which I have not used yet, but it has all the tools you would need ! I am happy I bought this instead of the plastic dyson, it looks like an overpriced plastic vacum cleaner, that does no different than any other vacum cleaner in an upper price range. The Hoover weighs 12lbs. it is GREAT.",0
"Pros: (1) At current (Walmart) price, this is an excellent value (2) sucks up dust/dirt very well (3) quiet and lightweight (4) excellent quality, over-sized bags that trap fine dust (5) the additional hand-vac works exceptionally well, has many attachments, and is very compact (6) the floor vac and hand vac have a nice, durable appearance and (7) though Walmart indicated a two week delivery time, I had it at my door two days after placing the order! Cons: (1) if using with a loose pile carpet, the roller spin is strong enough to unravel carpet on the high setting, especially at carpet seams. This is not an issue when using the vacuum on the low setting. I've used oreck before but have not tested dyson, and the quality of this vacuum is significantly better than oreck. It is just fantastically well built and the current, moderate price point will guarantee you a vacuum that will work well for years (i.e., there is also a long warranty on all parts of the unit, I believe) and will not need a replacement for some time. I'm happy about this because this is my third new vacuum in 8 years.",0
"This is the fourth vacuum I've purchased in the last two months, and the first one I didn't return. I'm very pleased with the performance of both the upright and handheld with attachments. I feel Hoover has come back to producing quality vacuums, and I hope I will be able to say this 6 months down the road. I have 2 terriers that shed constantly, and both vacuums pick up the dog hair quite well. The upright is streamlined and not heavy to pick up--and I'm not a very strong woman. Some reviewers have complained of the noise of the handheld, but I don't think it's inordinately loud. Yes, I would like it to be quieter, but it's average in my opinion. All in all, I'm thrilled with this vacuum pair and expect them to last for many years. One warning though, this upright is NOT for shag carpet! I have a shag area rug, and it is very hard to push and pull the vacuum over it. I must switch it to the low setting and lower the handle as much as possible to lessen the suction. Since I have only this one rug, I still love this vacuum for my regular carpetting, tile and laminate floors. Unless your house is mostly shag carpet, I would recommend this vacuum.",0
"I'm a Consumer Reports junkee and I tend to go with their recommendations. The Hoover Platinum got very high marks in their ratings, but I think it was passed over for the CR Best Buy because of its price of 400. That's why I was so surprised to find the same vacuum at Walmart.com for only 219. It was a no-brainer. It arrived very quickly, was professionally packaged, and easy to assemble. I immediately tried it on carpet, because this is one of the areas it was supposed to excel in. It did not disappoint. Even when I ran it along the baseboards where dog hairs accumulate, it did a better job than my previous high-end vacuum (which was twice the price.) It does great on hardwood too, and I switched it into the low setting for my throw rug, and it knew what to do -- suck up the dirt, not the rug. Wonderful product! It has special grips for vacuuming stairs and is easy to handle -- I'm a weakling so I appreciate its light weight. This vacuum was designed by someone that actually does the vacuuming at their own home. I can't comment on its reliability because I've only owned it for a month, but I have no buyer's remorse. I LOVE this vacuum.",0
"I love this machine. I tried a cheaper, bagless model, but hated emptying the canister and the belt broke after the third use. I took it back and bought this one - even though it cost almost twice as much - because of all the glowing reviews and I liked the idea of getting two vacs. THIS IS TOTALLY WORTH EVERY PENNEY! The upright is fabulous. It works just fine on my hardwood floors without scratching and picks up even the grass and leaves my dogs track in. I thought the days of buying a vacuum that lasted 20 years were over, but this machine feels so solid I can actually see it lasting that long. It reminds my of my mother's old green hoover that she used forever, except that it's a whole lot lighter and the floor actually looks clean after using it. The canister is also very lightweight with good suction. But it's really not very thoughtfully designed. There's no good way to store the tools and no place to wind up the cord, so it's pretty unwieldy to get out and put away. Luckily I don't use it all that much. It's a shame that the folks at Hoover didn't take the time to put the same thoughtfulness into the design of the canister.",0
I was chosen to participate in a case study with this vacuum through a site called Cafemom. I fell in love with this product. I have a zoo in my house and it can get rather hairy. It picks up the hair with no issues and is easy to push around. Hi and low settings for different parts of the house and also has an indicator letting you know when to change your bags. The second little gadget that goes with it is easy to cart around and helps with getting gunk off the edges around the baseboards.,0
"I did a lot of research on vacuums before purchasing this one and I love it. The price was good and the vacuum works great. It is easy is get into tight spots, picks up great and it is so nice not to have to adjust it for carpet or tile floors. It adjusts itself. I also love the portable vacuum that comes with it. Before I had to lug my big vacuum to clean my baseboards and now I have a handy, compact vacuum that is easy to carry around. The extra long handle is wonderful and my husband loves it for vacuuming the car. I am so glad that I found this vacuum. Thanks Walmart for having the best price!!",0
"This is the very best vacuum cleaner I have ever owned, and I have owned quite a few. You may think the bagged vacuum is a thing of the past, but you are wrong! Those bag less vacuums spew dust in your face when you try to empty them. This cleaner is powerful, and the dust stays in the bag! Thank you, Hoover. Don't try to improve this one, please!",1
"I did a lot of research before I bought this vacuum, and I'm glad I did. It has turned out to not only meet, but exceed my expectations. The best things about this vacuum are the excellent suction, low noise, light weight, and the HEPA filtering...not to mention the 35-foot cord. I was a bit disappointed that the upright itself did not accommodate the crevice and upholstrey tools, but have really grown to like the separate cansiter vac that you strap onto your shoulders. It's also lightweight and does a good job cleaning. Some people here have complained about the price of the replacement bags, but shop around online. You can get the bags relatively cheaply on A*****. And the bags last longer than my other bags did in my old Eureka Boss, which I had to change when they were only half-full to assure the best suction. Plus, they are HEPA filtered.",0
"I read the MANY glowing reviews on this vacuum (lotsa sites!), and figured they must be Hoover shills- NOT! Fun vacuuming... Yea, sure- It's TRUE!- I vacuumed til 2am first time (I couldn't believe my eyes!)! My old CG Top-Rated 4.5hp canister would fluff up packed hallway... carpet (surface only!), but would quickly pack right back down. :o( The Hoover goes MUCH deeper (must go perpendicular/both ways..., or floats at higher side carpet level!), removed TONS of old dog hair, and REALLY deep fluffed up my carpet! After walking on it for two-weeks, my carpet is still fluffy! WOW! It was a pain on packed stairs (no more!), but worth it (sucks good when locked upright!)! Cons- The portable hand vacuum that comes with is a WEAK JOKE (one star, as they don't have zero!)!- I'll keep my powerful canister vac for the tools, as NO vacuum I've found cleans all the way to the edge (right side is close)! Sound Too Good to be true- Well Wally World has a liberal in-store return policy (even when purchased online!)! I guarantee you'll be AMAZED at the performance, and long warranty (you definitely get what you pay for!)! Scott :o)",0
"My wife has purchase every vacuum cleaner ever invented except the Dyson and I refused to spend that kind of money on something that would not produce an absolute vacuum, which is theoretically impossible. Nevertheless, we bought another, that makes seven now in our possession however I must say that the Platinum vacuum by Hoover is the best engineered for the money I have ever seen. If only Wal-Mart would stock the bags for it, it would be as close to perfect as I would require.",0
"In tough economic times it was a bit difficult to spend this much money on a vacuum but my house requires the best vacuum out there to deal with the fur from 3 cats and big dog and two daughters with long hair! This vacuum gets everything, it truly works edge to edge. I can clean right up into the corners without having to switch to the hose feature. It has rubber wheels instead of plastic which are so much more durable and much easier on my wood floors. The true test was whether I could clean cat litter without feeling it spraying out behind the vacuum...a huge success! It's so easy to use and comes with a 6 year warranty. A GREAT vacuum whose weight allows me to carry it up and down the stairs easily.",0
I purchased this set for myself for Christmas 2012 and both are awesome.I had a old Upright Hoover for 25 years..and it finally passed on..so this is ow I came to the new one..AWESOME..dont know how I have lived without this little cannister vac..I use ot more than I do the new upright which both are awesome I have NO complaints whatsoever. And the customer service people are jsut awesome too..I just love Hoover!!,1
I am glad to be using a vacuum with a bag once again. I have had several Hoover bagless vacuums. Removing and replacing the bag is a lot easier.,1
"I am a mom, homemaker and professional maid by trade. I have had this Hoover for 3 years and it runs as good as the day I purchased it! The wheels are fine and not flimsy at all. This vacuum, by far, outperforms the Oreck on cleaning and suction. Also the Oreck has left black marks on my customers carpets when the supposedly superior wheels get a little milage under them, and I have had more problems with the belts on the Oreck then the Hoover. The canister that comes with it is great as well. Nice long cord. Use it to on hardwood and tile before mopping to clean up dog hair, food, and debris and, of course, the stairs. Very easy to change the bag with a nice feature that keeps the dust from flying everywhere when you remove the bag (Oreck does not have this). Also a light takes the guess work out of when to change the bag. There is a convienent handle on the back of the vacuum that makes it extremely easy to carry up and down the stairs, and the canister has an adjustable and comfortable carrying strap. While cleaning floors with the canister the best way to wear this is with the strap all the way extended and across your body instead of hanging off your shoulder, that way you are free to move quickly and you won't have it slipping off your shoulder and dropping to the floor. I love this Hoover, in my opinion it was worth every cent and I am going to purchase another one to keep on the second floor.",1
This vacuum was recommended to me by a friend. The first time I used it I didn't know what to expect. She told me it was very powerful and she was right. It picked up everything. I believe we made a good investment in purchasing this product.,1
"This is a great vacuum. It has a lot of suction power, which I've had a hard time finding in previous vacuums. Very satisfied with my purchase. And a great value as well.",1
"Very good vacuum, light weight, easy to handle and very good suction. I also like the smaller attached vacuum. Easy to use on stairs, under furniture or cracks in floor.",1
This vacuum bundled with a smaller one is a great value. The main one works well on carpet and the smaller one easy to carry around and a substitute for small jobs.,1
"While vacuum shopping I was disappointed to see how many leading vacuums were bagless. These ""filter bags"" are not cheap but they're great for households with allergy issues (the bags on the upright even seal as they're being removed -- great design!). The upright is very light and the canister is great for getting in the crevasses and for use in the car. I even use it to suck the dirt out of my little Electrolux battery-operated hard floor vacuum, which allows me to benefit from its ease-of-use but not have to fling dirt and dust back into the air while emptying it. I wholeheartedly recommend these Hoovers!",1
"Absolutely love this vacuum. It is extremely light to carry up and down stairs, is self-propelled so it is super easy to use, and has great suction. Very happy I purchased this vacuum.",1
Very nice Vac set. Good for a house.Powerful. And you can actually get the cleaniness same as that by a professional.,1
really like having 2 vacuums when I don't want to get the big one out,1
"This vacuum set is awesome! Love the canister for car, stairs and wood floors. Love the upright for carpets. Great suction on both machines. Both lightweight and have long cords for easy use.",1
"Overall, this is a terrific vacuum. The person who will be happiest with this combination is the person who: (1) wants a lightweight vacuum, (2) has mostly carpet in their home, (3) has carpeted stairs, and (4) uses attachments.",1
"This is my second Hoover vacuum cleaner in more than 20 years...just shows how sturdy and reliable this product is. This new Hoover is a lightweight product which really cleans with a bang! Have only had it for a little over a month, but am loving it big time!",1
"This vacuum combo is powerful and makes cleaning the housemuch easier to accomplish.I compared with Oreck and found this unit at least as goodand less expensive.Warrenty is for 6 yrs.The upright vacuum is easy for stairs, too.The competitor is not.",1
Great pick-up suction and light enough for small female to carry. Have recommended it to others.,1
"This vacuum really works, so well the noise level doesn't matter. Added an extension cord in order to do the entire house. Now that I am able to find the replacement belts at Best Buy I am very pleased.",1
"I bought this after having tried a dyson and not liking it. I have owned orecks for years and really like the lightweight vacuum. I think I actually like this hoover better than the orecks I have had. It cleans the carpet as well as the dyson and does a better job on the bare floors. It is lightweight and extremely easy to push around. It doesn't spew dust like the oreck did and the bag seals when you remove it so dust doesn't come flying out. Has a very long cord so you don't have to keep unplugging it. The handheld vacuum seems to work well, has good suction. It is lightweight and easy to carry around. I wish there was a power brush attachment for furniture. Overall, this is a really nice vacuum cleaner for the price.",1
This vacuum comes in two separate units. Very light weight and both of them are powerful. Love it.,1
Excellent machines - both the upright and the hand device are excellent products that work well - you can certainly feel the quality when using them. We have had several vacuums over the last 15 years and the suction of of this upright is very good.,1
I love this two-piece set from Hoover. Mom's friend checked mine out and bought two! I cleaned my home very quickly!,1
Very lightweight and easy to use. Attached canister vac helps with the stairs. Cleans very well with minimal effort.,1
I love this vacuum. It is light weight and has very good suction. It also fits under small tables and the kitchen counter.,1
I haven't used the little handheld yet but the upright works great. I don't like bagless vacuums so this one is just what I wanted. It picks up well (including the pet hair) and is easy to move it around. I'm very pleased with this purchase.,1
"Love my new vacuum; even my husband likes it. So much easier to push than my old Hoover WindTunnel, which had excellent suction too, but just was so heavy use anymore that it kind of sat in the closet, only to be used primarily to clean the car. I started to use my Hoover Linx to do the everyday vacuuming, though it works well, it really was not giving our carpets a proper cleaning. I have been a Hoover customer for the past 40 years and never really had a problem with any of them. I just got the bug for a newer model with little more power and more features, every few years or so. I probably have averaged about six years per vacuum and since this vacuum has a six year warranty, I should have it for at least that long. The separate little canister is nice to have and has excellent suction too. The only problem I have found, when you have it close to you, I feel a lot of warm air coming from it, which is a bit uncomfortable. Others have complained about it being noisy, but I don't think it is that bad.",1
I love the Hoover-Platinum. 2nd one I have owned. Just gave the first away to my Mom and she loves it! Also I am a bag girl. I do not like the bagless sweeper.,1
I've had this for about a week and have had no problems.,1
This is a very nice and powerful vacuum. Works great on carpet and hard floors. It's very light and easy to move around. I highly recommend this product.,1
This vacuum is great for taking up and down stairs and also for vacuuming stairs.,1
"I purchased this vacuum due to it's high rating in Consumer Reports. It replaced an Oreck xl which is overpriced and only offers fair performance. It is as light as the Oreck but has a ton more suction. The Hoover pulls the nap on the carpet up like the Oreck never could. I like that it includes the separate canister vac and that it has HEPA bags. Definitely a great deal, we will see how long it lasts.",1
"you can practically carry this around with three fingers, built to last, when doing steps with the upright they put a handle at the bottom of the vac so you can control it better. no adjusting the vac from carpet to hardwood, only one setting.",1
"This Hoover vacuum is excellent for picking up dog fur. Also, the portable canister vac is great for stairs, easy to carry. The main unit is solid with a strong motor.",1
"I love the fact that there is a separate handheld that you canuse for stairs, furniture, etc. The upright is pretty quiet as vacuumsgo. It's also pretty light.It's great that it's HEPA also. Even the bags are excellent. You canclose off the bag so that the dust doesn't get out when you remove thebag. Obviously this is great for people with allergies.Overall is very well built and does the job. We'll see how it doesin the long run.",1
"I have had this vacuum since September 2009, and have been very happy with its performance. I have two large dogs, and the vacuum does an excellent job in picking up dog hair. The replacement bags are pricey, but they are a good size, so you don't have to replace them as frequently as other vacuum cleaners.The small cannister vacuum is really convenient for use on furniture and stairs, but the suction isn't that great.Overall, this is the best performing vacuum I have owned.",1
I had a Dyson for years and reviewed a lot of vacuums before deciding on this one. Compared to the Dyson it is so light weight and vacuums so easily. The only complaint is that it's not that great on my laminate wood. I have to go over it a couple of times. I wish it had a bare floor option so that the brush could be stopped while vacumming bare floors. It seems to do fine on my tile. And I do like the separate canister-It makes vacuuming stairs so much easier and I like it for quick clean ups and getting under furniture.,1
This is the first vacuum that I have ever owned that truly works! I have a house full of boysand my carpet has never been cleaner! It really works well in high traffic areas.,1
this vac saved my life! ...i am so glad hoover is still around!,1
"The Hoover is a wonderful vacuum because of its dual function. Also, it has plenty of power and is very light and easy to use.",1
Great vac for the price compared to other big name vac.,1
My mom is 76 and no longer has the strength for her Hoover Wind Tunnel. Its very heavy for her so I bought this one because its much liter and rolls very easy. The suction on both of them is really good and the upright lifts the nap of the carpeting really nice. You can tell the difference after you go over the carpets. Its pretty quiet and has a bright lite for darker areas. The idea of a full bag reminder is a nice touch also. The cord is so long< I never had to unplug it. The instruction book is very simple to read. This is by far an excellent machine. Definately buy this one. Hoover has done it again.,1
"Great powerful vacuum. So far I have it for a 2 weeks and use it every other day. It sucks all the dog hair up with out a problem and it doesn't tangle around the brushes. The canister vac is great too, once I got used to the idea of a seperate unit. Very powerful!!!!",1
"We did quite a bit of research on HEPA vacuums before settling on this model. So far we LOVE this vacuum. You can easily spend $500 for a Oreck Vacuum that has these same features - but save your money, this Hoover is all you need.My son has a terrible dust mite allergy, we notice a difference already in his breathing due to b- weekly cleaning with our Hoover.",1
"I have always had Hoover products and very satisfied with them. Last year I tried a couple of other brands. I took them back and stuck with my Hoover. Recently, my Mother did the same thing. She & I both need the lightweight. I let her try mine and she agreed that it was the best for her. I purchased this one for her. We both spent a lot of time searching and returning. I suggest saving your time searching and purchase this one. The time you save, you can use cleaning!",1
"We bought the vacuum because our old vac stopped working. This one is fantastic. It sucks like a champ! I did not think we would use the portable vacuum, but we use it a lot. The portable works great on small messes. It also has all the attachments. I really wish the vacuum had some of the attachments, as the portable one just does not clean as well as the large one.",1
A lightweight but powerful upright vacuum. (I haven't had a reason to use the canister vacuum yet.),1
"Believe it or not, way less messy to empty and clean than those bagless vaccum cleaners. I had one before this that I practically needed a mask to empty... And if I tried to do indoors, I would have to vaccum again... This problem does not happen with this product.",1
"Purchased this for my daughter, she really likes it, it has a good drawl and is easy to move about. The smaller vac is perfect for cleaning the tile and does a good pick up is easy to store very satisfied with purchase",1
"I have used Dyson, Orek, as well as vacuums from Sears. My last Sears vacuum died, so after a friend told me about this one, and recomended it, I decided to give it a shot. This is the BEST vacuum I have ever used. The separate canister has more than enough power, as does the upright. My Wife has bad alergies, and the vacuums we have used in the past have bothered her, despite their HEPA claims. This one doesnt trigger her alergies. The upright does a better job cleaning the carpet than any Orek or Dyson I have used.",1
"This is a very nice vacuum. If I had to do over again, I would make the same exact purchase. A vacuum is only as good as its design - so don't be fooled by what some might say - light wieght and fewer amps do no result in scrafice. This is vacuum delivers on its promises and I am 100% satisfied.I did a lot of research and compared many models including the higher end - $500 - $600 models. In the end, I based my purchase on my percieved view of quality (first hand comparisons) and what I read on review sites like Consumer Reports. There is a lot of great marketing of tunnel technologies, rolling balls and selling with British accents but I perfer to pay for actual performance.",1
"I am use to middle of the road cheaper upright models, that might last a couple years. I have owned this ""dynamic duo"" for a short while, and bought it after yet another backbreaking cleaning day. I was weak!! When I started them up to clean my house (we have 11 rooms) I was actually smiling. With 2 cats and a dog, we are never short of pet hair. I figured it would leave some, I was wrong. I wasn't bent over my stairway forever trying to get all the hair sucked up. In fact, I wasn't bent over at all. Where my upright couldn't go the canister can, and I was even amazed at the power that little thing has. My big test was small area rugs. I have never had a vac that didn't grab the ends, suck it in, and burn out a belt. I put the Hoover on low and gave it a try. I am so impressed. Now I am writing this review. Yes, it is a little pricey, but with a 6 year warranty, two vac's, and alot of extra time to do other things (instead of marathon vaccuming) I am one very pleased lady. I would reccommend this pair to anyone, especially anyone that breaks their back with their present vac (like I did). I have never spent this much on a cleaner, but it was so worth it. Every aspect about these vac's were as advertised, actually better than I expected. One screw assembly, very lightweight, and a powerhouse. Bravo! I have become a Hoover fan with a push of a button. The review I read on how it could ""suck up a Buick!"", was on the mark. What an awesome machine!!!!!!!!!",1
"Works great on carpet, tile and hardwood floors.",1
"First, a disclaimer of sorts . Im a long-term, died-in-the-wool Hoover evangelist. No, I dont work for Hoover, but Ive used Hoovers religiously for 30 years. Ive tried switching off to other top-of-the-line brands, but always returned to Hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliability.That does not, however, mean they were perfect. The Hoover WindTunnel U6439 bagged upright that Ive had for the last several years would suck up a Buick. Unfortunately, it also rivaled a Buick in the weight category. Although its supposedly a self-propelled model, I felt like I had to go into training in order to vacuum my house. It became something I would put off because I wasnt sure I had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my house. The WindTunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual, hard-to-move levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate them. The HEPA filter on my old WindTunnel seemed to work only for the first few months. After that, all manner of airborne particles would fly around as I vacuumed, even after I cleaned/replaced the filters. Lastly, noise of my previous WindTunnel was something akin to a jet taking off.When I saw a TV commercial for the Hoover Platinum series machines, I was definitely intrigued. I loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price (brilliant marketing idea there, Hoover). But I was skeptical; could the power of a Hoover truly be housed in something that weighs only 11 pounds? Id tried other lightweight vacuums in the past and their suction was dubious at best.I made a beeline for the Internet to start researching. Over a couple of days of intensive reading, I decided to continue my trust in Hoover and took the plunge.Both machines come packaged together in a single tall box which was waiting for me on my front porch when I got home from work. The first thing I noticed was that I could actually lift the entire box into the house without grunting like a Sumo wrestler that was promising. After removing everything, I was stunned at the weight  or lack thereof  for both machines.The physical appearance is very appealing; the upright is sleek and slim with a 35 long cord, and the canister has tools-on-board, along with an ingenious shoulder strap so you can wear it while you vacuum. You will be stunned by how little these machines weigh  a child could easily lift them both. But could they clean?When I fired up the Platinum upright, the word that kept coming out of my mouth was WOW. First off, no more jets taking off in my living room  just a pleasing HUM. Second, this impossibly lightweight wonder gives a whole new meaning to the term self-propelled. It seemingly FLOATED over my carpeting all on its own, while still having the suck-up-a-Buick power I expected from a Hoover. It cleaned better in one pass than its older U6439 WindTunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes. I was picking up stuff I didnt even know was there. Whether vacuuming underneath your bed, or behind that dresser that you havent moved since you moved in 15 years ago, it was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one pass.I have a rather large, bulky throw rug in my kitchen that I had been preparing to replace because it had become so un-vacuum-able in recent weeks. The Platinum upright made it look brand new. And hallelujah for a TRUE edge cleaner! Everyone claims to have edge cleaning ability on their uprights, but this one truly delivers on the promise. Think about those sneaky areas in your house where all sorts of stuff lingers  like that dead zone along the baseboards tucked up under the bottom of your kitchen cabinets where they meet the kitchen floor. This Platinum upright sucked up all that debris  right to the edge.The maneuverability of the Platinum upright is astonishing. It truly is as light as Hoover claims and it moves as easily as a Dyson. The upright portion of the machine lowers completely parallel to the floor so it really can move under coffee tables with ease. It also moves from carpeting to floors effortlessly with an intelligent, lighted, fingertip control right up there on the handle.The HEPA filtration is light-years ahead of my previous WindTunnel  think HEPA with a Hemi under the hood. Yes, I know that bags are expensive, but you can find discounts if you search online and buy in bulk. I dont mind paying for a product that truly works  these bags, and this new Platinum HEPA filtration system, truly work. No dust or other airborne nasties were visible anywhere.The Platinum canister has a carrying strap, which makes so much sense. The folks who clean my office building uses strap-on canister vacuums and I always what an intelligent design  now, Ive got my own. And all the tools are right there attached to the unit, ready and waiting for you. I toted that canister all over the house, cleaning window sills, ceiling corners, air conditioning vents, everything! Then I walked into the garage and cleaned the inside of my SUV. Its quiet, powerful and incredibly portable  the best canister Ive ever used.In my first test run of this Hoover Platinum vacuum system, I found myself LOOKING for stuff to clean; I couldnt get enough of it. The Hoover UH30010COM Platinum is, quite simply, the best vacuum PERIOD Ive ever owned. I absolutely LOVE this machine  and to get 2 vacuums  an upright and a canister  for the same price just makes terrific economic sense. It has extraordinary power in a relatively quiet, sleek, lightweight package that doesnt leave me feeling deaf, sore and exhausted. Bravo, Hoover!",1
Best vacuum I ever owned!I love that it's the best of two things.... the upright is great because it's lightweight and doesn't have all the hoses. The side vacuum is great because it's more portable than dragging around the upright.The overall look and feel is high end. Definitely recommend... much better than a bagless model. A+!,1
"Excellent Value- both the smaller & larger vacuum work very well, & NO dust when removing Bag, as compared to the canisters I've had before.",1
"I bought this vacuum pair based on the reviews. Had I simply been browsing in the store, I likely would have chosen something else because for the price, it doesn't look like you're getting much. I am so glad I went against my instincts and listened to what others have said about this unit. It's awesome! It leaves the carpet looking like it's just been steam cleaned, not merely vacuumed. (No, it won't remove stains. It just really picks up the nap and makes the capret look new.)This is a case of simpler being better. I work for another retailer that sells Dyson, Electrolux, Hoover, Eureka, and Oreck. I have seen that the units that get returned most often are the ones with too many bells and whistles and gimmicks. This set just does what it is supposed to do: vacuum carpets really well.The canister is super lightweight too, but has awesome suction. My only knock on it is I wish it had a little longer hose to make it more suitable for cleaning the car. But for inside the house, it's great. The extending tube locks at any length you choose and works great for hard floors and ceiling fans and stuff like that. The tools are nothing to get excited about, but do the job. I stopped at a local vacuum store and picked up a dusting brush with longer, softer bristles than the one supplied so that I could vacuum electronics without scratching up the plastics. ($7)Points that I would counter from other reviews:1. ""The hose falls out of the canister easily.""No, it does not. Twist the hose to lock it in place, and then it's acutally kind of hard to remove.2. ""The canister is super loud.""No, it's not. Of course this is subjective, but to me, it's much quieter than vacuums I've had in the past.3. ""The bags are very expensive and hard to find.""The bags can be tricky to find in stores, but are readily available online. They're about $5 each, but to me that's not bad at all when you consider they are really big bags, you're getting HEPA filtration and never have to replace a seperate HEPA filter unit (which really can be pricey), and they have an automatic ""trap door"" that slides closed when you remove the bag so dust doesn't go flying everywhere. Value.For inside the house, this is the best vacuum solution I've owned, and even though I was really reluctant to spend $300 for this, I have no regrets.",1
Suction is superb. Brings the nap up in the carpet. I was surprised that it was so light.Long cord is a plus. Cleaning steps is a little awkward with the upright. Overall I am extremely pleased and would highly recommend it!,1
"I hate bagless vacuums and I wanted to find a really great vacuum without spending too much but not spending too little either so I wouldn't get a junker, and I found it. This vacuum glides smoothly and easily fairly light to lift up and it's got plenty of power, it picks up dirt impressively. Very happy with my purchase and I enjoy the canister as well.",1
I like it because it's not to heavy and easy to carry on around the house to clean up. also cleaner well and clean,1
"I love that there are two vacuums. The smaller vacuum is great for stairs, and small jobs. It's lightweight, has a long extension cord, and it has a powerful suction. The upright is also lightweight, it's easy to maneuver, and has a powerful suction. This is the second time I purchased this vacuum set. I gave the old one to my daughter because she was always borrowing mine. It's a great product!",1
"I was looking to go back to a bagged vacuum because I was tired of the extra maintainance my bagless vacuum required (filters, cleaning) all the time. I have owned bagged Hoovers in the past and trust the name. When shopping for appliances I always look to Best Buy first and saw the Hoover Platinum Collection. I'm so pleased! Not only did I get an upright vacuum that really cleans my carpets and is easy to handle, I also got a handy porable canister vacuum! The canister vacuum comes with a hose, wand, attachments and a shoulder strap! I cac clean anywhere from my ceilings to my baseboards without killing my back! Both vacuums come with generously long cords that let me plug in one room and clean my entire two bedroom apartment with out moving the plug! I also loved Best Buy's price!",1
"I love my Hoover Plantinum Lightweight Vacuum. I am not kidding when I say - "" I can't wait to vacuum""!. It is so easy to make my carpet look great. The vacuum is self propelled, and as long as I am moving forward - ""it is literally vacuuming itself"".I can really tell how worthless my old vacuum was. When I vacuum, the suction is so strong, I can feel the carpet lifting away from the pad. When I am finished, you can see the carpet pile stands up!And on a Hot sumer day, I can leave the drapes closed - the light on my vacuum is bright enough to see where to vacuum.""What took me so long to replace my old vacuum ?""",1
"Bottom line: Upright is best vacuum I ever used. It is so powerful, it suctions itself to the carpet and makes a seal. Yet at 12 pounds it moves very easy. It is also quiet. I went to a bagged vac because I was sick of cleaning those nasty filters. Canister is nice touch too. It is a little wierd to carry around a vac, but it is light and has a good shoulder strap.",1
"After reviewing dozens of customer reviews, I decided to order this package of Hoover Platinum Vacuum.Overall I got an excellent product for my money. Not only it is easy to work with, but it is very pleasing to look at. Nice design, good colors, long enough cords. Now I can say I finally enjoy vacuuming.Most importantly I enjoy the result. After using more expensive bag-less vacuums that did a good job cleaning up the floors, area rugs and wall-to-wall carpets, but left behind airborne dust that settle after cleaning, I resolved never to by a bag-less vacuum again.This Hoover Platinum is really a dream when it comes to lasting dust free results. An other feature worth mentioning that the upright is self-propelled and requires minimum effort to push and pull. Now our 2,200 sq.ft. floor space takes one third of the time to clean than with my previous ORECK, Dyson and other models. It is excellent on pet hair as well. Our American Bulldog's white hair no longer covers the nooks and crevices, since it is quite easy to reach everywhere with the canister attachments (assuming they will stay on better)I ordered a bunch of bags already, as I never want to be without. My solution for odor coming for the bag (animal hair, dander) to add some organic air-freshener balls to the bag before starting to vacuum.",1
Both pieces of this set has done an excellent job for us.,1
"This vacuum has everything I need. There are no replaceable filters like all of the bagless vacuums that are out these days, and the bag seems very large. The suction is great and picks up pet hair easily. Extremely light weight and easy to manuever. The only downside that I noticed is that to use the attachments you have to use the canister. Otherwise, this is an amazing vacuum. :)",1
"I bought this vacuum for a new home I bought in Florida. The vacuum has a long cord, powerful suction, and it is lightweight. I have used it on both carpeting and hard surfaces and it picks up nicely on all surfaces. The vacuum lies flat allowing me to easily vacuum under pieces of furniture. I have not used the separate hand vacuum that comes with this vacuum, but I am sure it will come in handy for many areas including vacuuming my car's interior.",1
"excellent value, great product, wonderful warantee.",1
"Upright vac is very lightweight !! Fits in all the corners nicely! Canister vac is awesome , just strap on your shoulder like a purse and vacuum your stairs with ease!!!!",1
I love this vacuum. it is the best vacuum I have ever had. it is light weight and cleans great. the portable small canister makes cleaning steps and small places easy.,1
I am so glad I purchased this vacuum-I own a cleaning business and the the hand held mini vacuum is awesome-the upright I use primarily at home and I love it!!!,1
I love this vacuum! Does a great job of picking up the dog hair. I highly recommend this hoover. The cord is long enough that I don't have to continually unplug it as I go from one room to another.,1
"After months of researches, I decided to get this vacuum and I love it and really happy with the purchase! It is more powerful than I expected and it did clean the edges which I never thought a vacuum can do it. When I was doing the stairs, it was also very easy for me to carry and use it. The light is useful and the noise is not so loud.",1
Easy to put together. Only one screw to put the handle on and it was ready to go. Very easy to push and it is very light to carry up stairs. This is by far the best vacuum I have ever had and I have owned many. Great pick up power and easy to use. Great price and worth every penny.,1
"Easy Assembly, great features...auto height adjust, self propelled, love the fact that is bagged, great suction, the canister vac is great for hard floors and walls! It is all so light weight which is wonderful since i have 3 sets of stairs!!! This is a Great vac...I highly recommend it! 6 Yr warranty is great also!",1
Great vacuum at a great price. Used one and picked up pet hair better than old vaccume. Light and easy to move.,1
Works great! Have tried many another vacuums and this one is the best.,1
"It is the first vacuum that I really love with a reasonable price. It's light, but after cleaning the whole house, I still wished it could be a little lighter. It is so powerful and even cleans the edges well. It's easy to use on the stairs too.The Canister Vacuum is a bit loud and could be better if I can store all the parts with the vacuum itself. I love its clean design with the color that you don't get bored easily. I'm recommending it to all my family and friends. My husband and I are really happy with the purchase.",1
I had gone through numerous bagless vacuums over there years and was sick of the filthy mess they created when emptying. They also had what seemed like 3-4 different HEPA filters that always got clogged. This bagged vacuum has been great. Very strong suction for such a light unit. I'm very pleased.,1
"I was stuck between the Hoover and the Dyson. The dyson looks great and it claims to never lose suction. I went to a specialty vacuum repair shop (trying to fix my previous vacuum) and asked about the dyson. It's snazzy and has some pretty cool features, but it only sucks on one side of the vacuum. The hoover sucks equally along the brushes. Problem number two: the dyson frequently gets cloggs in that same hose. If it has cloggs, how can it suck? Apparently you have to take a wire hanger and fish out the hair and dust that caused the clogg...gross!Back to the hoover. Amazing! You can feel the resistance as you pull the vacuum back. I thought my floor was clean before, but the bag told me otherwise! I think it's strong enough to suck up its own cord (which is very long). It is much quieter than my old vacuum and the bag is made out of some cotton micro material that keeps all dust inside. The canister it comes with is great for small pick-ups or cars. I put the vacuum together in 2 minutes and have loved it ever since. I've been using it for two weeks and haven't found a problem yet. The price is great for such an amazing machine.",1
"For those of you who need a review to consider buying this, here it is:I have been using this vacuum for about a month now and absolutely love it. The suction is great.....no complaints there. Sorry I waited so long to buy it. I used to have a Dyson, but it was so heavy, and I always had to dump the canister which would cause the dust to go back into the air, and it would not reach under things due to its size. I use this vac almost everyday due to 3 cats and 1 dog, and am just amazed by how well it picks up all the hair. Sure, you have to buy bags, but at least you won't get all the dust flying around as you would with the bagless vacs.I got the canister vac with this, but really don't use it unless doing under cushions. I have had no problems with this vacuum picking up all the dirt, etc. along the bottom of the baseboads.....it gets it all.",1
We needed a vacuum cleaner with bags. This one is light and does a great job on our floors. We have a German Shepherd who sheds a lot and we have no problem with this machine.,1
"My wife asked for a new vacuum cleaner and after researching on line I bought the Hoover. She is very happy so far. It pushes easily, picks up dirt and loose carpet fibers well, is light weight, and comes with separate small canister vacuum and attachments. This gift was a success.",1
I am very impressed with the fact that there is a portable vacuum cleaner which has the hose & attachments. Great for hard-to-get-at places. The main unit has great suction & is extremely light.,1
"Great vacuum! Replaced my canister vac for something with a bag and had only used it for about a week and there was an easily noticeable difference in the amount of dust in my home. Lightweight and surprisingly low noise are two other great features. My dog is hardly affraid of this one! Well built, sturdy construction. Auto height adjusment for different carpets and rugs is wonderfull. It even looks great, you almost don't need to hide it in the closet.",1
great vacuum. Works well with plenty of suction. It is used everyday and have not had any problems. The small canister was a nice bonus.,1
"Great vacuum. Lightweight to take up and down stairs and excellent at picking up dog hair from a Malamute who sheds greatly. As stated, would prefer to have attachments on upright but do know that would increase weight. All in all best vacuum I've owned over the years.",1
"Looked around alot, tried the 12 lb Hoover vacuum, which did not work well on my carpets, so tried this instead. Not as light, but no bags. For the price, seems to be as good as a Dyson. Works well on all my carpets. The test is how well it lasts over time. My son is buying a T1 for his apt.",1
"After considering several reputable brands, I decided to go with Hoover. I couldn't be happier with this vacuum and the accompanying portable canister unit. The upright is a real workhorse. It sweeps both carpet and hardwood floors beautifully. The unit is light and maneuvers with ease. You can tell the moment you unpack these items that they are very high quality. The extra-long cord allows you to cover a number of areas in your home without unplugging and plugging into another socket. The canister vacuum is fantastic as well. It has surprising power and the attachments are handy for various cleaning jobs. The shoulder strap is a great feature too. You can't go wrong with this vacuum and portable canister.",1
"I almost bought a ""different"" $1,200 vacuum but I am glad I did not! I brought this home and vacuumed right away. Then, I looked in the bag and can't believe what it all sucked up...dust, pet hair, sand...it was amazing. You can feel it working while you vacuum. The light in the front is nice. It handles extremely well. It looks nice and it does not cost $1,200! I did my homework and this was ranked at the top, now I can see why!",1
"Absoluty love this vaccum, well worth every penny! And a 6 yr warranty, no-one can beat that!",1
The upright unit is quite powerful and does a thorough job. The portable piece is also very effective and easy to carry.,1
"This vacuum really sucks (which for a vacuum is a good thing)! Extremely light, easy to move around, and best of all, it REALLY gets the dirt and debris out of your carpet -- with this suction power, it lifts the pile on your carpet really well. Far better cleaning power than Dyson, for much less money. The included canister vac is nice, but very loud -- I consider it as a throw-in, and it works great for cleaning out the car and getting into corners.",1
"Hoover has cleaned our family's rugs for 3 generations beginning when grandmother bought her first one in 1921 followed a 1935 model used until her death in 1964.When mother married in 1941, she got the 1921 model which was then replaced in 1961. When I married in 1965, we got the 1935 model which was replaced in 1971. The 1971 model was replaced with the New Platinum bagged upright; only because I have a degenerative spine condition and the 1971 convertible was heavy and painful to push!The 1921, 1935, 1961 and now the 1971 are all carefully wrapped and stored in my basement; all in running condition. Maybe my 4 year old grandson will need a vacuum in 20 years or so.This Platinum Bagged Upright is powerful, cleans thick oriental rugs, low pile wall to wall carpeting and bare floors with no adjustments, fuss or bother. Because we have 7 dachshunds in our home ( 4 are ours and 3 are fosters for a local rescue group) I vacuum daily and this lightweight powerhouse is fantastic.In my opinion, the Hoover Platinum Bagged upright continues Hoover's century old heritage of well engineered, simple to use machines designed to do an exceptional job cleaning rugs, carpeting and bare floors with no muss or fuss!No fancy frills or sales gimmicks that break, need replacing or contribute nothing to the basic function of cleaning and grooming rugs and carpets...like some other brands.The Platinum bagged upright is just a Good, Solid, Dependable and well built vacuum that will do a great job for many years to come!I gave the canister to my daughter in law as it was too heavy to have it strapped around my neck. I have a 10year old full sized Hoover canister that I can set in the middle of a room and not have to move or carry to much. My daughter in law loves the Platium Canister for cleaning the ceiling fans in their 12 vaulted ceilings! So guess the canister is OK, too.Great product....only 1 small drawback. The bags are a bit pricey and neither of the 2 retailers that sell the Platinum bagged upright (best buy and Walmart) have the bags in stock. But, the Platinum Collection has its very own customer service phone number for any Platinum issues, questions or ordering supplies.. So, not a real problem!",1
This works great on bare floors. Picks up pet hair in one pass. The stair cleaner is also fabulous. I love this and would recommend it to anyone!!,1
"Finding a ""Good Bagged"" vacuum took some time to research. The hype towards bagless didn't appeal to me, so searching for this type of vacuum was like searching for a needle in a hay stack. Hoover Platinum was expensive, but it was well worth it. Not only it was a Bagged type, but it has great suction, air smells clean after vacuuming, and it comes with two vacuums (a push type that is lightweight, and a portable cannister with onboard tools that can be used for cars or carry around for floor to cealing cleaning). Also comes with a 6 yr warranty.",1
"I previously owned a Dyson and a Kirby. This vacuum cleaner is, by far, the best vacuum cleaner I have ever owned. It is far superior to the Dyson. It is lightweight and very powerful. I am extremely happy with this product!",1
Read the reviews and decided to go with this one over a Dyson... love how light it is and the power it has. Love the hand held small vac for cleaning stairs and upholstery! Want a second one for our vacation home now.,1
Let me just say this... I'm glad I took the time to review vacuums online. My wife and I needed a new vacuum... we previously had 2 Bissell's and they were GARBAGE - so we wanted to make the right purchase this time.We saw that Garry vacuum online and almost bought it until I read the consumer reviews on it. We were shopping at Best Buy and this thing and it really got our attention and meets all of our needs. It's lightweight and performs incredibly. What's nice is my wife and I can each vacuum and get the job done in record time instead of having to stop to get all the attachments configured.,1
"I read all the reviews and was hesitant to purchase such an expensive vacuum cleaner but one of the things I needed was something that was good at picking up dog hair on both carpeted and hardwood floors. I decided to try this since it got no bad reviews and WOW! I have never ever had a vacuum cleaner that had such suction and power. I was so amazed at how easily it moved due to the ""self-propelled"" mechanism.The only improvement would be to have some attachments on board so when you are vacuuming a room you could quickly do corners, etc., but then it probably would take away from the suction power! The little vacuum is very convenient for little jobs and it will work for when I need the attachments.One thing that I never saw in any of the reviews I read is that the vacuum cleaner bags are self-sealing. That means that when you remove them from the vacuum cleaner, they automatically seal so no dust or particles escape into the air. I always hated that when I had to re-vacuum after removing a bag. The bags are very thick and high quality so it's no wonder they are expensive.If you are debating about this one and you're on the edge, just take the plunge. You won't be disappointed!",1
"I previously bought a Bissel Pet vacuum, and it was horrid. I originally wanted this, but it cost more. After I returned the Bissel, I bought this one, and absolutely love it! I have Siberian Huskies, and they shed like crazy, but this vacuum picks up all the hair on the first swipe! It works fantastic. But it does use bags, and those can be a bit pricey, so shop around for them. Also, the ""Bag Full"" light goes on quite often, even if the bag is nowhere near full, but I just shake the bag a bit, and the light goes off. And since there is no attachment pieces, you have this little canister, which works well but the little bag fills up quickly, so it looses suction, but just empty it/put in a new bag. But even with those little things, this vacuum is FANTASTIC! Simply because it picks up everything so easily.",1
"I needed a vaccum so that my kids can also use it, so I needed really light weight. This one is cool, very light, easy to operate, excellent results in cleaning, look is very modern, hose vaccum is separate. Both units work great. The 2nd unit, saves time when you are cleaning stairs. You do not get tired as it is light. The wire is long , so you can go every where. I do not know why this was not displayed in show room, I had to oder it. I had read good reviews, so far after 2 months, I still feel much better, meeting the expectations.",1
I was pleased at how well it picked up everything and was not expecting the small canister unit that came with it.,1
Love this vacuum! It is lightweight and easy to handle. Deep cleans carpet.,0
Tried the bagless vacuums and had to replace them. This vacuum is great and doesn't have any dirt flying around. Love it!,0
This vacuum cleaner is the best cleaner I have owned!!!,0
"I am so glad we found this product. Our previous bagless vacuum's motor broke and I learned that bagless doesn't mean best hard way. So, I wanted bagged vacuum this time, but I wanted to touch it before buying. Local vacuum store had price range $500 and up. I was not ready to pay this much. Luckily, I found reviews for this model and decided to go for it. I can't say enough how happy I'm with it! It's light, it has features of all those expensive staff I tried in store and saw on Youtube but for the right price. That is why I decided to write this review. It helped me, hope it'll help someone else!",0
"I got tired of using bagless vacuums so I did some online research and found this beautiful vacuum. It's light, not too loud, easy to use, and the roller brush leaves my carpets looking like new. Plus it's not expensive compared to other popular brands.",0
"I couldn't be more pleased with this vacuum cleaner. Because it doesn't have all kinds of gadgets affixed to the arm it does not wear you out while using it because there is very little weight being transferred to the handle so the vacuum never gets to feeling heavy (I have a back back, and this makes a big difference). It does a very fine job and is quiet. The separate small canister vacuum has been easy to use and works well, too.",1
Then upright vacuum is great and the HI-Lo switch is convenient. The included small canister vacuum is a nice plus. Our grandson loves to vacuum with it.,1
"I got tired of cleaning the gross canister in my Shark vacuum, the dust and dirt would go everywhere! I thought it impossible that this was the only option available to collect the dirt. I came across this Hoover with the bag option and I could not be happier. I am a minimalist so I appreciate the sleek look and the colors. It comes with an additional portable vac that is light and has all the attachments you will ever need. I can't say enough about this purchase, so pleased!!!",0
This vacuum does EVERYTHING I expected and then some!I am Very Satisfied with this vacuum!,1
"I am so very happy with my purchase. I wanted a bagged, light weight vacuum, and this is perfect. Great suction power, and my carpets look practically new when I'm done vacuuming (and they are almost 10 years old). The canister vac (also bagged) was a welcome bonus. So easy to use, and no more lugging around a heavy bagless vacuum that has to be emptied every time it is used. Got it on sale, so that made me even happier. I would definitely recommend this combo for anyone who prefers bagged over bagless and wants something light weight enough to carry up and down stairs if needed. And which does a good job on hardwood floors, too!",0
I wanted a powerful but physically lightweight vacuum This filled the bill. Also I found dealing with the bags was a lot easier for emptying the vacuum than dealing with the bagless type.,0
"We bought this because my wife's old Royal vacuum is so heavy and hard to use. It also needs some repair to the handle latch.This Hoover is much easier to use and it does an even better job. We were concerned that there was no height adjustment, but this works equally well on carpet, hardwood, and vinyl floors. The handle for stairs is especially useful, as we have two carpeted stairways. The vacuum is so light it isn't a problem.In spite of the bad reviews on the canister, my wife loves it too. It is so very light it is easy to vacuum out the cars, and the long wands reach to the high ceiling on our back porch. It seems to have a lot of suction, and the noise is no worse than any other vacuum.We definitely wanted a bag vacuum, as emptying a no-bag vacuum is a messy operation. With the bag, you just remove all the dirt and dust and it is already bagged. Also, the bag offers a very large HEPA filter that is changed automatically when you need to change it. In one step you neatly empty the dirt and replace the filter.",0
"First, a disclaimer of sorts ���. I���m a long-term, died-in-the-wool Hoover evangelist. No, I don���t work for Hoover, but I���ve used Hoovers religiously for 30 years. I���ve tried switching off to other top-of-the-line brands, but always returned to Hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliability.That does not, however, mean they were perfect.��� The Hoover WindTunnel U6439 bagged upright that I���ve had for the last several years would suck up a Buick.

After removing everything, I was stunned at the weight ��� or lack thereof ��� for both machines.The physical appearance is very appealing; the upright is sleek and slim with a 35��� long cord, and the canister has tools-on-board, along with an ingenious shoulder strap so you can ���wear it��� while you vacuum. You will be stunned by how little these machines weigh ��� a child could easily lift them both. But could they clean?When I fired up the Platinum upright, the word that kept coming out of my mouth was WOW. First off, no more jets taking off in my living room ��� just a pleasing HUM. Second, this impossibly lightweight wonder gives a whole new meaning to the term self-propelled. It seemingly FLOATED over my carpeting all on its own, while still having the suck-up-a-Buick power I expected from a Hoover. It cleaned better in one pass than its older U6439 WindTunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes. I was picking up stuff I didn���t even know was there. Whether vacuuming underneath your bed, or behind that dresser that you haven���t moved since you moved in 15 years ago, it was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one pass.I have a rather large, bulky throw rug in my kitchen that I had been preparing to replace because it had become so un-vacuum-able in recent weeks. The Platinum upright made it look brand new. And hallelujah for a TRUE edge cleaner! Everyone claims to have edge cleaning ability on their uprights, but this one truly delivers on the promise. Think about those sneaky areas in your house where all sorts of stuff lingers ��� like that dead zone along the baseboards tucked up under the bottom of your kitchen cabinets where they meet the kitchen floor. This Platinum upright sucked up all that debris ��� right to the edge.The maneuverability of the Platinum upright is astonishing. It truly is as light as Hoover claims and it moves as easily as a Dyson. The upright portion of the machine lowers completely parallel to the floor so it really can move under coffee tables with ease. It also moves from carpeting to floors effortlessly with an intelligent, lighted, fingertip control right up there on the handle.The HEPA filtration is light-years ahead of my previous WindTunnel ��� think HEPA with a Hemi under the hood. Yes, I know that bags are expensive, but you can find discounts if you search online and buy in bulk. I don���t mind paying for a product that truly works ��� these bags, and this new Platinum HEPA filtration system, truly work. No dust or other airborne nasties were visible anywhere.The Platinum canister has a carrying strap, which makes so much sense. The folks who clean my office building uses strap-on canister vacuums and I always ���what an intelligent design��� ��� now, I���ve got my own. And all the tools are right there attached to the unit, ready and waiting for you.

"I have always had Hoovers and loved them (since 1970) I bought a bagless Bissell and when I saw this Wind Tunnel, I fell in love. My only problem was the recent problem with finding bags. You can have your Dysons etc. I am a happy woman!!",1
"We bought our Platinum Upright 2 years ago and we love it. We had bought a fancy new upright canister vacuum before that and it was heavy and always getting plugged up in one of many locations. This Vacuum is light weight and powerful. If you turn it on and let go of the handle, its so powerful that it will take off moving on its own. The portable unit that comes with it is handy and powerful as well. As long as we can get bags and parts to keep this vacuum running, it will always be cleaning our home. The only complaint I have is that the store we bought it at no longer carries it or the bags, so we have to order them from Hoover. GREAT JOB HOOVER!",1
"This Hoover is Best in Class, and with a limited six year warranty, you can't beat it. The Canister is also a great addition to this unit. Great for cleaning ceiling fans, stair, and hard to reach areas.",1
"This vacuum performs well above the competitors, and with a limited six year warranty...you can't beat it. The canister is also an excellent for cleaning those hard to reach areas and stairs.",1
"We have hardwood floor, carpet, carpeted stairs and tile and wanted a lightweight vacuum cleaner that could be used everywhere. This Hoover does it all and with minimal effort!",1
"WOW! I got mine from ... today and all I can say is WOW! Hoover you out did yourselves! After using a disgusting, clunky, poorly designed bagless Bissell, this is the most amazing vacuum I have ever used! My living room rug is an entire shade lighter! I don't feel like I need a shower after vacuuming now. I works beautifully on the stairs, no hoses needed. It picked up every crumb. I only had to change outlets once and I have a 2200 sqft quad level home! I have two small children, 1 dog 2 cats and it picked up everything! Assembled in minutes with one screw. Need to get used to the on/off switch b/c I keep hitting it when I vacuum...but definitely not a deal breaker! Love, love, love this vacuum!",1
"I couldn't believe how great this vac works! Contrary to popular belief, a vaccum does not have to be heavy and cumbersome to deliver awesome suctioning power. It works well and the filter is amazing.",1
"i live with two 80 year olds. this upright vacuum is light enough for my mom to easily carry upstairs and down. the first time she used it, she ended up vacuuming the entire house. she had not planned to, but said it was so lightweight, she did not tire pushing it around. and i personally love the lightweight canister vac. i take it to and from work to vacuum my office i use it in my studio, the laundry room, the stairs, etc. it too is so lightweight it is easy to carry to and fro. both the upright and canister are powerful but simple. my mother is not one to like complicated contraptions, so this vacuum was a wonderful find. i cannot recommend it enough.",1
"I bought this vacuum to replace an Oreck. It cost several hundred dollars less and is a superior product. I was surprised how quietly powerful the motor is. It has great suction and a very high-quality look and feel. This is by far the greatest Hoover product I have ever purchased. The handheld canister vacuum is convenient and extremely powerful. I couldn't be more pleased! Thanks, Hoover!",1
"I was on the fence about this vac, but once i unpackaged it, and put it together w one screw, I was allready intrigued, then as soon as I hit the power button, i was sold..the brush roll and height adjustmnt is auto, grooming the carpet as well as cleaning it, I like the groomed carpet look, and the color came back some to the carpet as well after several passes, so I knew the old vac, heavy and cumbersome wasnt working well at all, the canister is packed w power and easy to use w the shoulder strap making access to the tools easier than ever. Its retro look is attractive..heavy duty zipper and bag casing. And the best of all, lightweight, cleaning is work enough let alone having to haul the vac around. A bumper to bumper 6 yr warranty made the sale more attractive as well, w a 90 day return policy from .... This vac is stayng here though, one of Hoovers best and well built machines..nice Job Hoover..the price was perfect as well..",1
"I just bought one two weeks ago and love it! This is the first time our carpet has fluffed up since we moved in. I researched Oreck and Dyson. I was about to buy the Oreck, when I found this little vac. I didn't think I'd like the hand held that it came with, but I do! It too has amazing suction. I also like the way the upright picks up on the edges near the floorboards. I haven't owned it very long, so I don't know about the lasting quality, but so far, so good.",1
"Lightweight and Powerfull! Don't need all the bells and whistles just a vacuum. Just layed thick carpet and this machine is PERFECT! Tri-Level house so the stair handle works marvelous and is easy to move around. Also have Samoyed dog and it takes care of his hair, doesn't clog like the so-called pet hair machines that DO! The canister is a GREAT addition as I did our pop-corn ceilings as the ceiling fans create dust. Perfect machine... THANK YOU HOOVER!",1
"I love the fact that it's very lightweight. I use it throughout the house on my carpets, floors and tile. It is exceptionally great for stairs. I've always used a Hoover, but this is by far the best of the best. I've only had it a few weeks, but love it. The only thing I would change is to have the attachments on the vacuum instead of separate.",1
"All the features I disliked about my other two vacuums (both sold as commercial models from two different manufacturers)power cord too short, plastic parts that failed to hold attachments, difficult adjustment lever for different floor surfaces, to name a fewhave been addressed and improved with this model. I truly love it. It is compact in design but very well made--it reminds me of the older models that were built to last. It is lighter than my other two vacuums which really makes a difference when carrying it to the second floor. It does an outstanding job on pet hair, stairs, and my multi-surfaced floors automatically. I love it! I am so confident that I disposed of my other two models. I know this new Hoover can handle it all.",1
"Love it!! My bagless model was heavy and hard to use on stairs, I also had to empty the canister after every use and pound the filter clean. This is so easy to use on stairs and is so light. I've had it for about four months and replaced the bag once and it wasn't even full. It's easy to use and lightweight. Well worth the money.",1
"First, a disclaimer of sorts . I'm a long-term, died-in-the-wool Hoover evangelist. No, I don't work for Hoover, but I've always used them religiously for over 30 years. I've tried switching off to other top-of-the-line brands, but I always return to Hoover for their unsurpassed cleaning power and reliability. That does not, however, mean they were perfect. The Hoover WindTunnel U6439 bagged upright that I've had for the last several years would suck up a Buick. Unfortunately, it also rivaled a Buick in the weight category. Although it's supposedly a self-propelled model, I felt like I had to go into training in order to vacuum my house. It became something I would put off because I wasn't sure I had the strength to wrestle this bulky beast all over my house. The WindTunnel controls which allow you to change the brush height from carpet to floor were manual, hard-to-move levers on the brush housing which required you to shut the machine off in order to properly manipulate them. The HEPA filter on my old WindTunnel seemed to work only for the first few months. After that, all manner of airborne particles would fly around as I vacuumed, even after I cleaned/replaced the filters. Lastly, noise of my previous WindTunnel was something akin to a jet taking off.When I saw a TV commercial for the Hoover Platinum series machines, I was definitely intrigued. I loved the idea of getting two separate vacuums together for one price (brilliant marketing idea there, Hoover). But I was skeptical could the power of a Hoover truly be housed in something that weighs only 11 pounds I'd tried other lightweight vacuums in the past and their suction was dubious at best. I made a beeline for the Internet to start researching. Over a couple of days of intensive reading (yes, I'm very thorough), I decided to continue my trust in Hoover and took the plunge. Both machines come packaged together in a single tall box which was waiting for me on my front porch when I got home from work. The first thing I noticed was that I could actually lift the entire box into the house without grunting like a Sumo wrestler that was promising.

It cleaned better in one pass than its older U6439 WindTunnel behemoth cousin did in several passes. I was picking up stuff I didn't even know was there. How about making a pass underneath your bed, or behind your dresser that you haven't moved since you moved in 15 years ago It was astonishing how well this machine worked in just one pass.I have a rather large, bulky throw rug in my kitchen that I had been preparing to replace because it had become so un-vacuum-able in recent weeks.

"Threw my old bagless vacuum away and went back to a quality bagged vac.This vaccuum is the ultimate vac for everything but really excels with pet hair.Its powerfull,lightweight,and best of all CLEAN!!!We absolutely love it and it is worth its weight in gold!!",1
This is my first Hoover. I love that its lightweight so easy to push around my carpet and furniture. It was easy to set up and works like a dream. I love my new Hoover. The wind tunnel technology is amazing. I love the Hepa bags and now know that my house will be free of dust and allergens. Great suction and brush fluffed up my matted carpet. My 5 year old Kenmore recently died and I replaced it with this Hoover. I'm not disappoined. I'm very happy that I did. My Kenmore weighed a ton and was bulky. Hand held canister is great on corners and tile floors. Also great to clean around my air conditioning vents and dryer lint catcher area. I am very satisfied with this vacuume. Great product.,1
"Pros:Excellent for carpet, carpeted stairs, pet hair, included canister easy to use, both exhaust CLEAN airCons:No on/off brushroll for bare floors - upright meant for using mostly on carpetThe person who will be happiest with this combination is the person who: (1) wants a lightweight vacuum, (2) has mostly carpet in their home, (3) has carpeted stairs, and (4) uses attachments.Special Note: This two vacuum set (upright and canister) now is only about 300 a terrific value at that price.",1
"Dating back to the Hoover Convertible, I have used various Hoover Cleaners over the years, including bagless and bagged Windtunnel models. Yes, folks have had issues with previous models, but Hoover engineers seem to have resolved those issues with this Lightweight Platinum vacuum that runs and cleans like a champ. Accompanying this upright with a separate canister is a great idea that Hoover once marketed in the 1980s with the Concept Two. I'm glad they brought this idea back. Hoover offers this Lightweight Platinum upright and canister for a price not out of line in exchange for the quality and the warranty that you get. If you buy it, you'll soon see that it's worth the investment. This is indeed the most user-friendly Windtunnel I have owned. Using is believing, and I see how easy it is to navigate around my furniture and how well it cleans and grooms my wall-to-wall carpeting on three floors. The canister does well in and of itself, but I am not too fond of the combination brush that is included. I think Hoover could have done better here. Fortunately, all of the tools that are included with a self-propelled Windtunnel that I have can be used with the canister, including the turbine tool. If you want another vacuum and can swing the purchase price, get the bagged Lightweight Platinum combo. You will appreciate it as soon as you get it home and turn it on.",1
"Overall, this is a terrific vacuum. The person who will be happiest with this combination is the person who: (1) wants a lightweight vacuum, (2) has mostly carpet in their home, (3) has carpeted stairs, and (4) uses attachments.",1
"I like the installation, it did seem to be very secure. It does offer a good handle for help getting in and out of bed and a help for them to reach and rollover.",1
IT is very helpfull getting out OF bed.,1

was good,1
This fragrance will turn heads. I get a lot of compliments.,1
This unit was exactly what I was needing for an audio install. The glass door means that they can use the remote controller with the door closed. Do watch out for hidden damage though. The packing around the cabinet in the box was thin and mine had a couple of dings on the corners.,1
"This flavor is always popular with my two year old no matter how picky he might be. I He loves all the HappyTot flavors. I love the added fiber and omega 3s he gets through the addition of chia seed. Not only is this all-organic, but the boost in nutrients keeps me going back for these. Convenient for on the go and quick snacks... A must have for busy moms.",0
My son loves this mix. It's a perfect fall flavor and I don't have to peel a butternut squash. I especially like the addition of chia for omega-3's because I find it hard to work into my son's often limited diet.,0
"This combo is so simple and it is so good! My kid will always eat applesauce but I love that I can step it up with the addition of butternut squash! Plus, the chia and fiber make it a great option when she needs a snack.",0
"I love butternut squash, so I wanted to try this pouch when I gave it to my kids...and it was tasty! I also used it in muffins that I made for my son's preschool Halloween party. I used zucchini, carrots, banana, and this pouch to make a healthy fruit/veggie cupcake. The kids gobbled them up without even realizing there was chia seed or so many healthy nutrients in them! I like that it has omega 3's and fiber, as other reviewers said... basically, I really recommend this pouch flavor to every parent!",0
This isn't my girls favorite flavor right out of the pouch (they will only eat it if there are no favorites left!) but I love using it in place of apple sauce in my baking. It brings so much more to the table with the added goodness flavor.,0
"The blend of apple and butternut squash is great balance of mild sweetness. (yup, I've tried it myself!) I try everything before my little one eats it. The consistency is great and definitely saves me when my daughter stays at grandma's house! I also use this blend to bake delicious muffins!",0
"Butternut Squash and Apples are always a favorite in our house. Even the older kids love this one. It tastes just like applesauce but still loaded with a bunch of Omega-3's and Fiber. That's something that's lacking in a lot of toddlers diets. This is an effortless way of giving my little one everything he needs and he enjoys it as well. Also, as a parent of a child that has a variety of food allergies, I truly appreciate Happy Family for labeling their products well, making shopping for food a quickly and stress free experience.",1
This is certainly a favorite in our home. My boys love the flavor and I love that Happy Family included Salba Chia. During this time of the year I always feed my boys foods that are high in Vitamin C and this pouch satisfies that requirement. There is also 3g of fiber which I love. I'm lucky my boys share because I will often have one of these pouches as an afternoon snack!,1
"This Happy Tot blend is my toddler and preschoolers favorite on-the-go blend! We toss it in my diaper bag, activity bags, lunch bags and have even brought a bunch of pouches to preschool for the class snack! I love that it is organic, allergy friendly, packed with omega-3s and convenient! They love the flavor and that I let me have as much as they want! ( :",1
"This was the WORST pizza I've ever had in my life. The crust was gross. The sauce was delicious but there wasn't much of it. There also wasn't enough cheese. Bottom line, don't buy it. Try a different gluten free pizza. Amy's Drive Thru has some great ones.",1
great prices and fast shipping,1

Quick Fast Low pricing thanks.,1
Seems relatively painless so far.,1
Ordered from here once before got exactly what I ordered fast and and excellent condition. I will be ordering from autoplicity again.,1
good,1
"easy, smooth transaction. Reasonably priced item. I was hesitant when reading some negative reviews, but took a chance anyway. I'm glad that I did. Item quickly received; no problems. Will buy from again.",1
Fast / Easy Straightforward,1
Thanks. Best price + shipping I found.,1
"Ordered before reading the reviews. I bought this specifically because it said Ultraviolet Copy. Wanted it for my UV collection. You only get one code and it's for Retribution Only. NOT THE ENTIRE COLLECTION! It's the only reason I dropped $34.99 plus tax on this. I have since contacted the 800 number for Bestbuy. I have been given authorization to either get an exchange or a refund, even though it's now an open package. I am going in the morning to go talk in person to the manager and tell them what's going on and give them the reference number that was given to me. I will see if they have one in store that they know 100% supplies the UV copy for the entire set. If not I'm just going to return and get my refund.",1
I enjoyed the movies and the video games. I read the reviews and decided to buy the set for the digital copies of all the movies. I was upset it was only a copy of the last movie only. Total waste of money. I want to return the set for that reason.,1
"Description says UV digital copy, once i received the set only one disc had a UV code, it worked for the one movie but what am i suppose to do for all the others? called customer support they said there should be a code that gives me the digital copy for all. They sent me another box set, same issue, went into the store and no one can figure out how to get me what they are advertising and what i bought! Ugh!",1
The movies just suck. The first movie is okay but gets worse with each sequel.,1
Great movies all in one video box and also at a fantastic price.,1
"Honestly, I knew how terrible these films were but I was bored and needed something to binge watch...since I'm all caught up on every show I currently watch. The first ""Resident Evil"" is actually not that bad of a film. The rest get worse. Incredibly worse!! The price wasn't bad for the collection.",1
Misleading. The digital that download is only good for one movie in the series.,1
"This series is one of those where you can sit down and watch the whole thing on a lazy day to keep yourself mildly entertained. There are some cool moments throughout the various films, but nothing spectacular about any of them. A guilty pleasure for sure.",1
Great deal for pretty average movies but Blu-rays look pretty good and I only paid five dollars for five blu rays.,1
"If you are a fan of the Resident Evil series then this box set gives you the first 5 with the nice outer box sleeve. In terms of physical product style, it's cool, basic, but cool. The movies are fairly lackluster in my opinion with the first one being a flawed ""okay,"" and then the second and third one being more B movie fun, before the series becomes unwatchable with the fourth and fifth film.",1
Always a fan of the first one but after that it gets pretty cheesy,1
"Just like any other Movie series, the sequels never seem to match up to the first movie.",1
I just like watching zombie films with science fiction action,1
its a good collection to have can't wait till the next one comes out,1
We had seen movies 1 and 2 before and liked them fine. When we saw the movie set we thought why not. We enjoyed all the movies and are looking forward to the newest one coming out soon.,1
"It is a great collection, the only thing only one movie has a ultraviolet copy, otherwise good collection.",1
I like resident evil. Its great to have most of the movies on blu ray,1
4 of the 5 are good. Good action. Best video game movies for sure.,1
"Only half of these are watchable, the rest are total garbage.",1
It's the great collection thats packaged altogether too bad it's a repackaging of the original individual films. also the digital copies all expired in 2014 but you may get them if you actually contacts Sony. Save your money wait for the next collection to come out,1
"Growing up I have watched all of the Resident Movies and they are not Oscar worthy but rather popcorn/throwaway films. I have a lot of fun watching these movies but you cannot deny that these movies have gotten worse through each sequel after Resident Evil Extinction. All I can say is that if you like these films then buy this collection right now because the price makes it a steal! However, if you are a collector then be cautioned because this collection only include the digital copy of Resident Evil Retribution.",1
They aren't the best movies in the world but they are entertaining enough. Except the last one.,1
Got it as a gift for my grandson who really likes it but thought it was a bit to strange for me.,1
"The Resident Evil 5 Pack Movie Set was Sold at a very good price. this multi set Movie is Packed with a lot of action and blood. I view this as a down fall of movies. the 1st and 2nd got my attention , then the rest seemed to be repeats over and over. so I lost my interest in this set of 5 movies. I mean , when a movie continues , it need to keep the attention of the audience like ""SAW""",1
"If you missed out on this series this set is a great way to catch up.I'm half way through and enjoying the series.A great movie series for zombie fans, but if your not there's still great action scenes and a good story.",1
"Really good price, but wasnt to impressed with all movies.. Afterlife looks and sounds great but not 1-3",1
"I already had 3 of these on dvd but worth 15 bucks to upgrade to blue ray and add to the set. Nothing wrong with these films, they are what they are. Zombie action type stuff that's just a bit of harmless fun. Kinda funny because you can clearly spot in the filming style between films exactly when ""The Matrix"" came out.All in all just good harmless fun for those moments when you just fancy something a bit mindless and at 15 dollars for 5 blue-rays it's a no brainer value wise.",1
These are fun action movies but if you've ever played the games you might not enjoy the movies.,1
We love these movies and had seen them all before but the collection had such a FABULOUS price that we were happy to be able to go back and see the old ones before the new one (and final) Resident Evil movie. If you Love the genre you will not be disappointed with this collection. Amazing Deal that we just couldn't pass up!,1
I had all these movies on DVD and wanted to get them on bluray. Price was great to upgrade and add the digital copies at a reasonable price,1
"Not a huge fan of the series, but found a couple of the movies worth while.The price was one I was comfortable with, so it's a pretty good deal.",1
"The movies are ok, not the best, but could be worse. I'd advise buying the set if you're a fan or are looking to upgrade your DVDs to Blu-Ray. Each movie is individually wrapped so even if you own one already you can just sell or give away the new one.",0
"Some are great, some are lousy but they are all a fun ride.",1
I was glad to see this box set that included all 6 Resident Evil movies. Been wanting all of them for some time but didn't want to pay for them separately,1
Nice box set of all 5 of the resident evil movies. Gave them as a gift and they loved them all.,1
"Honestly, no one watches a movie like this because it has the greatest plot; they watch it for the action. The acting talent was great, the action sequences were good and the plot was descent, even with the plot holes. Overall, these were highly entertaining films, though some were better than others.As for the discs, it irritated me that they are set up so if the movie is stopped before it is finished you have to go thorough all of the FBI warnings and then search the movie to find your spot unless you set a bookmark from the menu before the disc is stopped.",1
Someone stole my DVDs so I was so happy that best buy had all 5 in one :),1
Absolutely love these movies (more so than the games) and this box set is the perfect way to add them all to your library,1
If a fan of RE than this is for you. All five in Blu-Ray together at great price.,1
"This is a great boxed set for a great price, thanks! :-)",1
"These movies are very loosely based on the Resident Evil video game series, but they're still fun action-filled movies with great stunts and cool visuals!",1
This set provides a great collection of all of the Resident Evil movies so far. The Picture quality is great!,1
Purchased the movie to round out my collection of the franchise. It did not disappoint.,1
I was very pleased to be able to pickup the Resident Evil collection at the price it was on sale for!!!!,1
This is a great purchase for any resident evil fan. To get all of the movies at the bargain price that I did is simply a steal!,1
"Good movies, great for resident evil fans, good special features",1
I'm a big movie collector and this set was a great add to my collection. I have always enjoyed The Resident Evil franchise and games. I would definitely recommend this series to a friend.,1
Classic collection of horror movie she is good in all 5,1
"The Resident Evil series doesn't require deep thought or reflection, but on balance it is better than it has a right to be, although the fifth installment was a bit too much like a videogame (I know the movies are based on a video game, but the last installment had a little too much of that feel to me). It's a great series of movies for exercise on a treadmill or spinner bike.",1
"Over a good series in my opinion, best way to have the series all in one place.",1
Doesn't necessarily follow the same story as the video games. But it's decent for the fans. Plus the price isn't bad.,1
Couldn't pass this deal up and I completed the whole collection in one set. Love it!!,1
Convenient package of all the movies if you didn't get them as they came out,1
"After the second one, I really couldn't stand the movies, but my wife loves them. Even with that, it's a great set, and a good price. Includes:Resident Evil - A guilty pleasure that mixes a few points from the video game with an overall good zombie flick.Resident Evil: Apocalypse - A definite attempt to merge the first movie with more elements from the game.Resident Evil: Extinction - Um... who put zombies in Mad Max?Resident Evil: Afterlife - This movie was primarily made to undo the third one and overuse every 3D gag in existence.Resident Evil: Retribution - Like the fourth one, but want more... everything? Then this movie is for you.",1
Has a great story line and kickass star. Good quality discs,1
"Great series, Milla pulls off this character in all the movies. Some of it is a little out there but building a 5 movie ""quintology""? based off a video game is quite impressive",1
great price for the blue ray collection good quality,1
"Though the series has declined some as time has gone on, it is still an enjoyable one to watch from beginning to end. Can't wait for the last film next year.",1
All the action on all 5 films in one blu-ray box set sold!,1
"A box set only including the individual discs that you could purchase separately in a nice slipcase. Nothing too special.These films aren't great, but if you love the games and you've seen these before you'll love it!",1
I like the complete series in one nice packaging plus the digital copies for all the movies. All for a very good price.,1
these movies are great for fans of the games and non fans alike...The films got better and better and better. 2 things missing: in-depth features helping those not familiar with the games see how they are all related; and the inclusion of the CG animated films in the series would have been nice.,1
"Good to get the entire ""resident"" collection for a better than decent price. Thumbs up to Best Buy for the fast shipping!",1
"Thank you, I wish to see them again. M.J. sequels get better.",1
"Very cool storyline. Some of the movies are better than others in the series but, good overall.",1
Purchased as a gift for a teenager. The girls all watched the movie the very same day and they enjoyed it.,1
"Milla Jovovich is The Perfect ""Kick Butt"" hero. She plays her role well and manages to look great doing it.",1
It's nice to have all of these on blu ray and it didn't cost much,1
I love zombies. I love these movies. Watch them. Now,1
"I wasn't into these movies when they came out, but glad I bought the box set. Just another good purchase to add to my growing collection.",1
It was a good collection. It started off kind of slow but it really got going.,1
It's looks amazing with the blue ray and amazing zombie action,1
Convenient packaging for a great series. Each film is faced with new challenges.,1
These films just keep getting better. Non-stop action and gore. They're even making a sixth film.,1
It was nice to find as a set. I had an issue redeeming digital copy however Sony pictures customer support was quick to fix it.,1
I love Alice and her quest to bring down the Umbrella Corporation. I finally have all of the movies in one set. I watch these every chance I can. Looking forward to the last installment.,1
"Very impressed with this box set, always been a big fan of them!",1
Overall a very good box set. Resident Evil movies have non-stop action and great CGI. Milla is the perfect actress to play the lead role. Looking forward to seeing the last movie for this collection coming out in 2017.,1
Great set of movies that take the source story from the games and makes it their own.,1
Great way to catch up on the movies. Purchased while it was on sale for $14 so couldn't complain considering it was Blu-ray quality.,1
This was an opportunity to upgrade some of my favorite movies without having to buy them individually. I usually wait for the bundled series to go on sale like this set was.,1
"The collection itself is great (got it on sale for 29.99 and had a gift card), however it states that you get a digital HD version, which would lead one to assume it is a digital HD version of the entire collection.THIS IS NOT THE CASEYou only get the digital copy of retribution. I spoke with multiple reps at best buy and all of them stated that it should come with the entire collection.The price was great, it's a great set of movies but the advertisement for digital HD is incorrect and not what I was looking for. Make sure you realize you are only getting ONE movie in digital HD",1
Great movies all in one set. Great price. Action and color vibrany,1
These movies are always ones that I am willing to watch from the past,1
Some better than others and none as good as the game but still like it.,1
Get the best of the resident evil movies in one set,1
"Even though they don't really follow the lore laid out in the games, they are still good action movies! They are a good homage to the games and the Resident Evil universe in general, well worth watching.",1
A good set of blu ray films at a great price as well,1
Was a really good set of movies. Had the blu Ray version and digital copies,1
Great movie collection. If you like zombie movies!,1
I like most of this series. A couple of the movies are a bit cheesy but still like the action.,1
if your looking to just buy all the movies at once then this is for you,1
"Usually these boxed sets are great because they come in a slimmer package and you can save some shelf space. But if anything this actually takes up MORE space because the box casing just holds the five normal blu-rays. So I docked it a point for that, but it's otherwise great if you're a fan of the films, and you really can't go wrong at 14.99 (even if you already had one or two of them it's a great deal).",1
All 5 movies for one great low price. Recommended.,1
It's great to have all 5 movies in one box.. The one thing I don't quite understand is why they didn't wait to release this until after the last installment comes out next year?,1
Ienjoyed this collection of cd's and would recommend to others .,1
Great movie collection for an amazing price lots of action,1
"Excellent action horror movie, must see the previous episodes to understand the story",1
Great deal if you can get it on sale. Only reason for one less star is the 3d versions are not included.,1
Great set to catchup on all old movies before the new one comes out,1
Great way to purchase this collection. I purchased when on black Friday.,1
All these movies are great. Nice grab before the final one comes out next year.,1
"All of these movies look and sound great! Great deal to get the whole set for $30, really makes the purchase well worth the money.",1
"I've been a fan of resident evil since it came out back in the day, I only have the first movie on DVD so what is on the 5 movies in a box set I had to pick it up!",1
These movies are entertaining. Each one for a different reason. Shut off you brain and go for a ride through zombie town. get caught up for part 6 coming in January.,1
These movies are good for what they are- senseless violence.,1
Great value. A must for any Resident Evil movie or game fan.,1
Good collection of movies to catch up with the franchise before the new one,1
Unbelievable price for 5 BluRay movies and a digital copy of one of the five as well all in a nice collectors box.,1
Great Sci Fi action film collection. It an old skool video game....,1
I bought this set to replace my DVD movies with Blu Ray. I really like the Resident Evil movie franchise. They have found interesting and creative ways to keep making these movies without being repetitious. Some of the movies are better than others but the action makes all of them entertaining.,1
Great value for all 5 films on Blu ray! This is a must own for any Resident Evil fan and a great addition to any Blu ray collection!,1
"I've been a fan since the first one and when I saw this on sale for $20 dollars I couldn't pass it up! If you are fan, this is a must buy!",1
A great complete collections of a good sci-fi series.,1
This collection boxset has all the Resident Evil films except the final chapter. Each film is really action pack and good special effects. I plan to get the Resident Evil: Final Chapter bluray to complete my collection.,1
The movies themselves are pretty mediocre after the first one- but to get 10ish hours of zombies for 15 bucks- I am happy with my decision,1
"I had previously purchased a movie from this set and enjoyed it, but when I saw the first six movies in one set I purchased it without hesitation. The price was very reasonable. The only downside is that recently a 7th(and final?) movie came out.",1
5 films for the price of $14.99 on Blu-ray. It is a steal.,1
Been a fan of this series from the beginning and each films keeps bringing the cool mix of action and horror that I continue to be a huge fan of!,1
a great packaging before the series finale come out,1
Finally got to watch it it from the beginning without missing out on any parts. Pretty Good,1
"definitely a guilty pleasure. good kills , great action!",1
"I like these movies, found them on sale, in blue ray, with digital copies, had to have it.",1
"If you like this genre, you will like this film collection. Full of action and quite enjoyable.",1
Got it at a great price and the movies are full of action.,1
"This collection is very affordable and a must-buy for those who enjoy resident evil or zombie movies in general. I am glad it came with the digital copies of all the movies, so I did not have to keep changing the discs every time I watch them.",1
"Good collection for a low price. Bestbuy was able to price match, making my purchase all the more easy.",1
5 blu rays plus digital copy for less than 15. Amazing. The movies themselves are a little to be desired. And it's sad that they moved away from practical effect to cgi as it takes you outta the movies as they go forward. But a nice add to my horror (can we call it horror) collection,1
"I didn't really like these movies like I had hoped. They are extremely cheeses but if you have nothing better to do I guess it's not the worst. However to review the quilt of the set, I must say that $15 for 5 blurays isn't bad. Nothing special about them but it is a nice bundled discount.",1
Great deal on the Resident Evil Collection. Good bonus content.,1
Not a memorable franchise but if you are into lots of action mayhem and zombies then this box set is for you. I wasn't a great fan of this franchise but for this price I couldn't resist.,1
All of those on blue ray for that price is awesome.,1
My son and I love this series and we are getting ready for the new movie,1
This collection came at a great time for a great price. We are going to have to watch it again when the new one comes out.,1
I don't know about everyone else but I always thought these Resident Evil movies were a hundred times better than the video games. The video games were so cheesy and the voice acting was terrible.,1
Awesome collections has the movies 1-5 6 is out in theatres. Makes for fun movie nights,1
The series looks great on Blu-ray and the price makes it a no brainier purchase. Even if you're not a fan of the genre this collection is definitely worth the low cost.,1
Though they may not be the best zombie films. They are entertaining. Loved the collection only down side was that the digital copy code expired and I was really bummed by that,1
A great purchase. All the movies in one bundle. Not the greatest of the movies but still a good set for my collection.,1
Great price for blu-ray 5 discs..and one of my fav,1
"All the RE movies in one bundle, nothing else to say.",1
For the price you can't beat it. Very happy to the have series,1
Awesome series. Great find at an awesome price. The UV codes were still active and am able to view on my phone.,1
"I cannot comment on digital copies included or not since I have not opened them yet. But that is why I bought this set. Couldn't pass up when on sale for 15. First one is still the best, but others are still fun to watch.",1
"this is a great gift set for any sci-fi lover. if you love zombies and action, you can't miss with this set.",1
All 5 movies for $14.99 is a excellent buy. go buy,1
"I am not a huge fan of the horror genre or Resident Evil, but experiencing these movies is worth the (low) cost of entry.",1
Good collection to have and even better price! Worth it!,1
Having all the resident evil movies at one low price. Quality is great and the individual movies each have their bonus scenes,1
Good movies for what they are. Story doesn't follow games but good for movie plot,1
Resident evil was a good game and the movies was even better.,1
The price alone is worth it just for the ultraviolet copies.,1
This is a great buy if you're a fan of the Resident Evil franchise. You can't beat the price.,1
If you want to get into this series and have the patience for their being what they are (mindless action packed thrill rides) then this is for you.,1
Huge fan of this series I highly recommend to others,1
I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil series. Found this box set on sale for $20 bucks!,1
"Bought the set for my gf since she is a fan of the resident evil series and for the price that we paid for, it was a great steal.",1
"I've watched the first two of five so far. The first movie had cruddy upscaling, but I still enjoyed the movie. This was not an issue with the second movie. Looking forward to watching the rest!",1
"14.99 for the box set with digital is not a bad deal. Not the best movies, not the worst movies.",1
Classic movie series ! Still good to watch even years after !,1
Love that they had the whole collection for digital too.,1
It's exactly what I wanted. If you like the movies,1
Each movie adds a different twist. Too bad it didn't include the final movie.,1
Got all three movies at a steal! Excellent movies at a great price; gotta love Best Buy!,1
I enjoyed the special effects and fight scenes. good to watch if nothing else on tv.,1
Paid $15 for this! 5 movies for that price is a great deal.,1
This is a great value. All 5 movies in blu ray for this amount is a must buy. Excellent price,1
The first five movies in a well priced collection. Good value and the movies based on the video games are just plain fun to watch,1
Excellent movie collection and for a great price $$$.,1
5 movie collection for $15 on blue ray? Great deal.,1
Great price for the collection worth getting and watching.,1
I had to get this as it is one of my favorite series. I waited to catch it on sale so the price was great.,1
"If you enjoy mindless off the wall action, you'll enjoy this set!",1
Decent collection of excellent price. No regrets here.,1
I liked this movie................................,1
Really nice collection. Only bad part is that does. It come with digital copies or ultraviolet as stated.,1
I'm happy with this purchase. A bargain for fans!!,1
it was a pleasant experience! i love browsing through the movies for great deals.,1
Finally got all the movies at a great price. Can't beat that.,1
"My husband loves this series and when we seen the price, we knew we had to get it.",1
Got this collection for half off. Huge fan forever,1
Alice adapts to the changing world has plenty of action,1
I like the box set for it have all the movies in it and the digital nd with ultraviolet.,1
"Not a fan of all the films in the set, but the price can't be beat. You get all 5 films for less then the price of just one film.",1
"This movie is by no account a perfect movie, but given that it is a fun movie to watch. The acting is over the top and so are the effects, but in the end you will enjoy it as long as you go in just thinking of it as just a fun watch. As the series progresses the movies get crazier and crazier but it comes with territory. Just sit back and enjoy yourself don't think to much!",1
Picked this collection up at a great price. These are fun movies to watch.,1
Great bundle! love the series and great quality and fun to watch.,1
"What can I say, while all the Resident Evil movies are not the greatest, in this set you get 5 blu ray's for $15.....I mean come on even if you get 2 hours of enjoyment, that's still around the price for a movie theater ticket. Take a chance and enjoy if you can find it, took me 3 weeks of checking!",1
Enjoyed each Resident Evil movies now I have it in one collection. Great for my video library.,1
If you love this type of movie you will love to watch it.,1
I love all the movies from the first to the last allot of acction,1
"love the movies now i have the set, family not getting the movies this time around",1
Great price for the series plus on Digital download to,1
It's a great price for as many movies as you get. It's a great action movie set.,1
"I have the first two of this series on DVD. This packaged set gave me the opportunity to upgrade to blu-ray for not only the first two disc but all of the first 5 movies in the series for the price of a single blu-ray disc. The picture quality, color and sound is a great step up from the DVDs that I have in my collection. Highly recommended for fans of the series.",1
I love the collection must wished it came with the new movie in it.,1
"None everyone is into these movies, but I liked it.",1
"If you're an avid movie collector, a fan of the Resident Evil movie series, and somehow haven't purchased these movies, you can't go wrong with this 5 movie for $15 deal!",1
I would recommend this collection it play clears and amazing sound. If you are a resident evil fan get it,1
I got caught up on all the movies. Excellent movies,1
"These movies aren't great, but I couldn't stop watching. You be the judge!",1
Fun action cheesy movie mad it had to end. Good movie better price.,1
I thought it was an error at first seeing this 1-5 movie collection for $14.99 but it wasn't . Now I just need to add number 6 when it comes out on Blu Ray! I love looking out for deals like this at Best Buy. You have to look for them but they're there!!,1
No complaints here! Awesome bundle for cheap! Can't find better deals!,1
"This blu ray comes with all the Resident Evil movies except THE FINAL CHAPTER (and whether it truly will be, who knows?) As of this review, I haven't seen all the blu ray movies yet, so I can only comment that the ones I did see was visually excellent with good sound. The movies themselves are what they are. I personally enjoyed the first movie, while the rest of them declined in plot storytelling. (I have seen all the movies on various formats before.) For the price I paid, it was worth the value.",1
I brought this as a gift for a friend's birthday..,1
"I'm a little upset that only the most recent movie came with a digital copy, but for the low price, I'm willing to forgive.",1
Great price to own the entire series up to the final which I purchased separately. Far less than the entire 6 disk pack.,1
I really enjoyed all 5 movies in this collection. The video quality of the first 3 isn't as sharp as the 4th and 5th but is an improvement over DVD quality at least.,1
This is a very good set including 5 of the movies.,1
Great action movies if your expectations are tempered.,1
Quality of the blu-rays is great but it doesn't include the last film of the series.,1
this is a good movie for those nights when nothing on tv,1
Can't beat getting 5 movies for 25$. Enjoy rewatching these.,1
Got this movie series at an amazing price. If you're a fan of zombie movies this is a must own!,1
"It took a while, but I got through all of them. Then I bought the sixth installment which was crazy good. But I wonder when will Hollywood go back to using tripods? I'm getting nauseous watching all the shaky cam.",1
I finally saw these in correct order and it all makes sense now!!!,1
This is a great buy for all the movies in high definition. Highly recommend this for anyone looking to upgrade or just starting their collection!,0
If you are a fan of resident evil movies this set is great.... price is right and it comes with digital copies so you can watch anywhere. I am a collector and a fan so I picked it up and replaced my old dvds... regifted te dvds to my son!,0
Was a gift for my son- in- law. He loved it. I was looking for the collection in DVD instead of bluray.,1
Got the Whole set of Blue Ray for a Great price! Then for purchasing got a $10 gift card.,1
"I enjoy these movies for some reason, not sure why. I like that the characters go through out a lot of movies. I really like the Ultraviolet aspect where I can watch these on any other device as well. Not only do I have the movies to watch at home I can watch them when I am traveling with out having to bring the discs with me. Great feature there.",1
"After finishing walking dead tv series, netflix recommended the first resident evil and I was zombified! Good action an Milan stays hot thru the years. Must watch for apocalypse and zombie lovers",1
"I would've been content with only the first three movies, but I will take what I can get.",1
If you like the live action resident evil films then at $15 for the first 5 on bluray it's quite a deal.,1
"As a fan of the zombie genre, I am a firm believer that Resident Evil helped kick start the latest movement. These movies are a great horror/action ride. The movies don't follow the game play, so don't go looking for hidden clues.",0
Grest value on blue ray to get all 5 movies for this price!,1
"Adapted from the video game, this film series is an instant sic-fi cheese guilty pleasure for any fan of Resident Evil. Enough said. :)",1
These are great movies and can't wait for the next into it come out,1
Love the packaging includes an ultraviolet code for all films included definitely a great deal,1
"This is a great set to have if you are a fan of the series. The blu-ray discs were all in great order, they are put into a good looking box and they feature films 1 through 5. It was really worth the price, I looked around and found the same item being sold at other stores for about 30.00 over what Best Buy will charge. Truly a no brainer.",1
So glad I waited to get the boxed set! Wonderful gift idea for R.E. fan!,1
"this movie is just what it looks, action all the way through plenty of gun-fu and butt kickery escapist trill ride loved it",1
If you like this sort of entertainment you won't be disappointed with this purchase. Tons of action and excitement.,1
"Highly recommend, the last two movies are the best, the others are ok",1
I love this collection and will continue to watch them over and over they have a good story to them,1
"Not everyone loves these movies, but I really enjoyed them.Personally, I'm more impressed with the first 3 than the last 2, but still... They're a fun diversion!",1
These movies progressed nicely through. Each one has its own uniqueness and yet they all blend together. Watch them if you have not already.,1
"The membership is awesome, i can search for items and find when and where they are available.",1
"I mean come on, Milla Jovovich? Resident Evil? Great combination. The packaging for the set was minimal, which I prefer. Quality improments with the bluray is good. Highly recommend.",1
The box comes with ultraviolet digital copies of all the Resident Evil films.,1
These movies are so great especially in blu-ray format!,1
What could be better than Mila Jovavich in blu-ray doing her action scenes? This is a series that I wanted better quality on and it was a deal to get the entire series.,1
I just like these movies. I didn't think I would. I bought to watch over and over.,1
I grew up playing the games and loved them all except for 6. The movies may not be close to what the games are but still have that resident evil vibe and are all excellent movies. Wort every penny spent.,1
Love the Resident Evil movies and was excited to find them all in one box set and on blu-ray.,1
Love having the videos in one set so convenient for storage and for travel. The picture is clear. Blu-ray is like watching in the theater.,1
Loved these movies on dvd but I sold them to get these movies on blu-ray. I like them that much. You won't go wrong. THe sound is alot better to,1
These are good movies and the box set makes it easy to keep them together.,1
One of the best collection of movies ( series ). Nice extras as well.,1
Love this trilogy I'm a diehard fan of Res. Evil series,1
I love resident evil in all forms. whether its video games or movies,1
"Contains all five movies in individual bluray cases. If you're a collector like me things like this are very appreciated, especially with a lot of studios going with the cardboard route which often results in scratched discs. It's basically all the individual releases of the movies in a single boxset for the price of $37.99. Great price and worth every penny if you like the movies. If you don't like the movies at least you can add five new bluray cases to your collection.",1
It's always so nice to be able to find a box set and for it to be affordable!,1
These are my favorite zombie/action movies of all time.,1
I couldn't of got this deal anywhere else. It was a great deal for this movie.,1
"Debated buying just because I know there is one more to come but I said screw it, it's a good deal. Bought it on a Saturday then went on sale the next day...what my luck. Went back in and they gave me the difference back. Awesome! I'm a fan of the movies so this turned out to be a good deal",1
All 5 movies in one set for good price... gotta love it,1
This 5 disc set is fantastic! Well worth the money....will be a collectors item,1
"This review is really for the packaging of the set and not the movies themselves. I think the movies are great and I feel that the only reason to get a box set for yourself or as a gift would be if you had already seen/liked the movies and want to have them displayed and/or arranged as a set. To that end, the set itself is nice for the price point. It is basically all five movies in their individual cases with cover art (just as if you had bought them separately) and are put into a sleeve. That's all. Plain and simple. One thing to note: The inserts with the code for the ultraviolet download are all well past the expired date. This was not an issue for me since I just wanted the bluray disc and did not care about the digital copy, but is something to keep in mind in case you really wanted the digital download.",1
"This set includes 5, individually wrapped, BD movies in a sharp holographic collectors box. Product arrived quickly,as well.",1
"This BluRay set is will worth the cost of entry. Great picture quality, although the quality of some of the writing is suspect.",1
I love the Resident Evil movies. They're full of great fighting and action.,1
"Excellent Purchase, very convenient that all movies are boxed together for a great price, would purchase again!",1
I upgraded from DVD to bluray for a incredible price.,1
"Included ultraviolet digital code also, good movies for Milla Jovovich fans.",1
Yes I bought the complete set I loved it I can't wait for the next movie,1
Awesome movies at a good price. Had some trouble ordering online for in store pick up. Instead cancelled my order and purchased it in store.,1
Loved adding this box set to my collection it's full of great action,1
I love this movie series!! Now I have them all and can watch them any time I want!,1
"It's great to have all of these great movies together in one set. With a lot of the series now, the writers just get lazy and all they care about in a lot of cases is that the are watchable. With this series, they at least try to keep up with the original",1
Love the games love these movies they may be a little of but still awesome,1
Gotta be my fave film series based on a video game!!,1
Love the movies but wished there were some extra features on the collection.,1
I always loved these movies. I'm glad it finally came in a boxed set. I'll enjoy it every time I watch it.,1
I was impressed with the price for the whole set. Must get if you dont have.,1
The nicest movies compilation for the series. Much better than buying them separately. Picture quality is much better than DVD and supports 7.1 digital audio (with the exception of disk 1 only supporting Dolby Stereo).,1
The Resident Evil Collection Boxset is Awesome! Was really looking forward to buying it and glad I decided to purchase it!,1
"Resident Evil (Blu-ray Disc) (5 Disc) (Boxed Set) (Ultraviolet Digital Copy), Awesome!!!",1
Alot of fun for sci-fi lovers. A great deal if you get it on sale. Must get blue ray,1
All movies in the series for one low price. Can't beat it,1
I've loved the resident evil franchise since the first one came out.,1
Great price for the collection. Each movie separate disc... Overall great buy,1
All the Resident evil movies in one package. And includes the digital code,1
Awesome movies! Just like the videogames if you were ever a fan of the series. Keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time as you follow the story of Alice the byproduct of the umbrella cooperation you see her rise and the beginning of the end for the Umbrella Corperation it's one heck of a wild ride!,1
Thought the movie couldn't be better than in the theater? In HD it is better,1
It's a 5 blu ray box set for a great value. Quick shipping too.,1
I like that each movie had its own case and not just one case with 5 discs,1
"MILA IS AWESOME , SUPERHERO IN THE RESIDENT EVIL SERIES.",1
It is a good movie. I like watching action movies.,1
Good product to give as a gift for anyone that is a fan of the franchise.,1
Love this series if you are a fan of the movies this is a great set at a great price.,1
Best Buy has some really great box sets for awesome prices,1
Reseident evil is my guilty pleasure i marathon it every now and then. They're fun and silly. Nothing like the games but it is its own thing. This collection is worth it.,1
this is a great collection. If you are a fan of resident evil this was made for you,1
Great price for the set. Good group of movies if you are a fan of the games,1
My husband and I have searched for this collection everywhere. I'm so glad that best buy had them.,1
this is the best adaptation of horror games go. while not the best adaptation of the source its plays with a few elements and plays with it the first 2 are the best the franchise goes down the latest entry brings it back up. as for purist stay clear its an abortion if your a zombie action horror fan this will fill you up. wish the artwork was better for the collection as a whole,1
At first I only had the 1st 2. But all 5 in bluray!! Can't beat it for $30,1
The movies are great and entertaining the kids loved them,1
Great collection to have. Only downside is no digital copy.,1
"The Resident Evil movies are some of my favorites. This collection gives you all the movies in one nice package. I got it on sale for $29.99, could not pass up such a good deal. Especially with #7 coming in Jan, 2017.",1
"I'm a fan of these films. I understand that at times these films don't make sense but do they really have too? I mean they are pretty amazing and have pretty awesome action packed scenes. Had the series in DVD, when I saw this collection I couldn't stop myself from upgrading to bluray.",1
I have always loved the series just needed to upgrade to blu-ray for the collection.,1
One of the best horror series around! Each installment builds the mythology.,1
A great story line based on the video games. Milla is awesome and having all 5 movies makes for a great binge watch session if you haven't seen them all yet!,1
"great set bluray, comes with digital UV copies in HDX",1
Love the Resident Evil movies. They are a good to watch on a Saturday night.,1
"Amazing, loved watching one after another... good to have for any collector",1
Great Price on the Resident Evil Collection! This is the original Walking Dead before Walking Dead!,1
the collection is a must for any sci-fi fan! i really think the directors did a great job of tying into game franchise,1
"great movie collections, this pack is the real deal..can't much value wise and an awesome action film(s).",1
Good collecting also come in digital wish is was iTunes due but good movies to see,1
"I don't care if they make two many sequels, as long as long as Milla Jovovich is cast I will watch them, I have all of them on DVD so when this collection came out, I bought them. A great Zombie collection of movies",1
Just love getting all the movies in a series and in great quality format! :-),1
I'm a BIG FAN of this series and these movies...!!!,1
I love all these movies except the third one. Terrible movie. But the box set is still worth it,1
I bought this collection because I enjoyed the movies and wanted them in my collection.,1
This is the complete resident evil box set. Comes with all five movies starring milla jovovich. The movies just keep getting better and better as you watch them in order. The first movie has kind of a full screen display without black bars but the rest of the movies look great in widescreen with the black bars. Each movie is full of documentaries and extra behind the scenes. Looking for some good action packed zombie movies with a little bit of horror this pack is for you.,1
I've always loved the Resident Evil franchise and I was excited to see all five movies bundled in blu-ray.,1
Great Boxed Set Of All Resident Evil Movies On Blu-Ray.,1
Great extras. All the movies in the set. Awesome movies.,1
Grew up playing the video games and was so thrilled when they released the first movie. I bought them all as soon as they released after seeing them in theaters more than once. Bought each bluray as they were released then got this box set! Great movies !!!!,1
really good movie and getting the movie box set for cheap was awesome,1
"This is a great box set to owm, specially for the price.",1
These movies are amazing if you're into the zombie apocalypse thing.,1
I had all of them on dvd and i love them so i rebrought them on bluRay i love the picture perfect,1
"Finally got to see all of them, not just bits and pieces on tv. Yeah.",1
This was an awesome set to have. It was priced right and I now have all of the movies in Blu-Ray.,1
Movie is as smooth as it can be! It runs are great quality!,1
Great movie series great acting great picture highly recommended,1
Loved this movie 100% I think everyone needs this flick in there collection filled with a lot of action from start to finish I think it's better then the first,1
Best movies of resident evil totally based on the video games.,1
good movie collection from the franchise. a must have for the fan...,1
As a teenager I was big on gaming especially this game but to see it come alive on live action is a gamers dream come true. The special effects kept getting better with every movie. Worth every penny,1
These movies are my guilty pleasure. Most definitely worth getting on Bluray. A great addition to my movies.,1
Very good movies and a great actress. Very action packed.,1
What's not to like about a box set with all the Resident Evil films? Alice (Milla Jovovich) takes on the evil Umbrella Corporation. A well done migration from video game screens to the big screen.,1
I like having all the movies in the same binder. Once in a while I will the movies one a night for 5 consecutive nights.,1
5 movies for $30. $6/movie. Not a bad deal if you like these movies for some reason. I kinda do. Each movie is somewhat unique. Milla Jovovich wearing clothes and sometimes not. You probably know if you want to buy this or not.,1
"Great package! Love that they are all bluray, and retribution came with digital copy.",1
I really am enjoying this collection very much. I couldn't believe it when I found it at Best Buy!!! Thx guys!!!,1
This is an awesome collection of Syfy movies.I recommend watching all five films back to back.,1
"My daughter who's 27yrs old, my son who's 13yrs old & I (I'm 53yrs old) all love this series/collection of zombie, horror movies known as Resident Evil Collection. This collection is a must have for anyone who likes this type of movie. Great plots, great actors, great deal!",1
I like resident evil movies the 5 in one is good ye,1
Once I heard the final installment was coming soon I rushed on over to grab this! 5 movies for the price of 2 is a great buy indeed!,1
"Five great movies, and to get them all on Blu-ray, at a great price, I say ""Two thumbs up"" Best Buy.",1
Although it does not include the 3D version of the last 2. It still a great buy!! Also comes with special feature,1
This is a must have collection for any movie lover.,1
The five disc collection takes the viewer through all of the Resident Evil movies released so far. Yet after purchasing I have seen notices for a sixth installment. If you enjoy the plot you'll enjoy these.,1
From the begin to the end one woman fights the undead,1
This was a great deal on these blu Rays! I was wanting the whole set and the price was unbeatable! So happy with this purchase!,1
Excellent collection. No complaints. Definitely a movie worth watching again.,1
What more could you ask for if you are a zombie fan!?,1
I am a fan of Resident Evil and have been waiting a long time for them to make a pack with all the movies! and its Blu-Ray!,1
"Incredible movie series, especially in the zombie theme. Exciting, action packed.",1
One of the if not the best video game movie adaptation of all time,1
This is a must for any fan of the franchise!! My only complaint with this set is that it says with ultraviolet digital copy. I figured it would be digital for the set but it is only for the final film. Overall its a great set for those who don't already own them individualy.,1
"These movies are great to watch, good price as well.",1
My boyfriend's mom is quite in love with these movies. She was ecstatic when we got these for her.,1
"Really good clear pic on all the boy rays nice set that doesn't easily 'll out of sleeve box, if you like the res movies you will want this as a set.",1
I Love all the resident evil movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"If you liked the video games, then you should watch these movies.",1
Great movie set if video game to life is what you are interested in,1
If you like adrenaline fueled craziness that is the Resident Evil Movies this is a great value. I was going to wait until the movie was made and released and get all of the movies but that will be a few years from now and $30 was a price i couldn't pass up.,1
Loved Resident Evil collection..them zombies is no joke,1
"This is a great set, very happy with it and having a complete collection. :)",1
This is a great collection at a great price! Very happy with my purchase.,1
Great quality for watching a movie by using Blue-ray player,1
I enjoy sci fi movies. I can watch this movie over and over.,1
I would highly recommend this Blu ray movie set if you like theresident evil series.,1
This is an excellent series. Great way to spendo a rainy weekend!,1
Great movie bundle overall. Zombie type movies are my favorite. Every movie has a very good story to it.,1
could not find this anywhere except best buy......great value,1
Great price! Bought for my daughter in college and she loves it!,1
I love the video games this series is based of off.,1
"All 5 movies in one collection for a cheap price, you can't go wrong with that",1
"Didn't know there was a Blu-Ray box set and When I saw it, I had to have it!",1
"I played the original game which is what got me to watch the first movie. I have watched each one since. All of them, on their own, have been above average movies and I have seen each of them at least 5 times. I got the collection to watch them all together. Better deal to get them together than purchase separate!",1
This is one of the best science fiction series out there.,1
"Good movie collection. I like the Best Buy special editions, boxed sets, and exclusive covers. I usually purchase steelbook editions from Best Buy.",1
"Always liked watching her kick butt, great deal for me finding the box set. I would recommend them.",1
I came late to the RE franchise so I had seen parts and pieces of all 5 but not in any order and certainly not sequentially. Finally I get to see the sequence as it was meant to be - in order. Not much to say about the physical discs themselves - they work. But I've really enjoyed the collection.,1
"You get the first five movie on bluray, Though online in the description it said it came with all the digital downloads as well. it didn't.",0
This is one of my all time favorite movie franchise can't wait for the next one.,1
"What more can I say, certainly not the based directed or made series....and the forced 3D is definitely not something redeeming about the series, yet fun and actionable at all times",1
Great Box Set Featuring An A@* Kicking Zombie Goddess!,1
I always enjoyed the games even though the movie has nothing to do with them.,1
Was happy to find that they carried the entire series. Excellent picture and sound. If you're a fan get it,1
I love the resident evil series and to be able to have all the movies is awesome.,1
This set has it all. Great picture and sound for a great price.,1
If u like the resident evil series and want to see the final one next year then u need this box set it will get u ready for the final chapater next year,1
We enjoyed the whole series and this is a bonus to have them all packaged together in a set,1
"Loved the movies, so I had to get these on Blu-ray! You will also enjoy all the bonus features. Don't pass this up.....GET IT!",1
This collection is a great deal if you enjoy the franchise.,1
Great collection of all of the Resident Evil movies.,1
"Best movies I've seen in awhile, even if they are older now.",1
"If you like zombies or lots of fun action, this movie collection is one on the NEED TO OWN type. I saw all in theaters and enjoyed them.",1
"They are the only place I could find this set, and they always have the best prices. Upgraded to bluray and could not be happier with the product",1
Perfect gift for someone who loves the video games.,1
"I had played the original RE but never cared to watch the movies. After one day seeing part of the fifth one, and after having bought the re release of the remastered RE, I decided to give the movies a shot. They pretty much met my expectations of a video game movie in terms of quality, but I did enjoy watching them. I would say the first one is the best, and I didn't much care for the series turning into full, global zombie apocalypse in the third one, but I did enjoy them.",1
Even though another one is coming still being able to get all 5 movies for $30 is a awesome deal. They will prob make another collection with prob all 6 but at least you can wait till the new one goes down in price.,1
This packed film content is awesome; I always like all five films and now I can view them sequentially at any time.,1
Ive always loved the resident evil movies and to find this bundle for such a low price i am happy.,1
"All the movies in one box set is great, love this series.",1
These saved me a lot of money buying them individually. Love the collectors pack.,1
When you see all's the movie in a roll is really good,1
"If your a fan of the games or just like zombie type movies, this collection is well worth it.",1
"I got them for my son,I will be back to purchase more Blue ray dvd tapes for him.",1
This was an awesome deal can't wait til the new movie cones out,1
"High quality, reasonably priced, and a must have for fans of Mila J. Perfect for a weekend marathon of Resident Evil.",1
Definitely worth getting if you want the whole set!,1
How cool is it to buy every single one of the resident evil movies are less than $50 I think I told you not to $30 or under right under 40 but for everything on the movies now or is that just came out with a new one but until then I have every single one of them and I paid a really good price price for the Blu-rays great picture love the movie,1
"At $14.99 this set is a bargain, you get all 5 movies on Blu-Ray and on Digital HD. Decided to get this to watch in preparation to the final movie of the series.",0

We all know theses are a must have for friends or yourself great movies n awesome blu-ray quality picture is great sound good,1
"These movies are a lot of fun. Alice, played by Mila Jovovich, is one bad*ss protagonist and the main reason for watching these action packed zombie/mutant/undead movies. There's even zombie dogs!

"Only OK, because after buying it discovered that a final chapter movie will be released soon... SO, I'll have to get it when its released. There goes all the series fitting under a single cover. :-)",1
It's a good buy because you get all of the movies. You don't have to buy each DVD and the box set looks cool.,1
The Resident Evil movies are the most decent video game movies ever made. This collection is a great deal for all five current movies on blu-ray and digital.,1
Great movie resident evil collection! I love the video games!,1
"If you like a lot of action, zombie premise, government is the bad ""guy"", and super-human heroine, then you should get a kick out of this series of movies. Like a lot of these kinds of movies, it's not to be taken too seriously, but to be enjoyed for what it is. An end-of-days movie that the government ""with the best of intentions"" caused, but they also inadvertently created the solution.",1
Its nice to have all the Resident Evil blue-rays in one collection.,1
All 5 movies in this collection for a great low price,1
This is the way to purchase these movies. Came with digital also,1
I found this box set over the holidays at a great price. It's so convenient to have all the shows together.,1
Love this series can't wait for the new one that's coming,1
Keeps you on the edge of your seat and the suspense. A very thrilling movie,1
"If you are a fan of Resident Evil you can't go wrong here. These are the same disks as sold individually, only at a StupidDeal price! Absolutely, unconditionally recommended!",1
Nothing better than the Resident Evil series of movies! Can't wait for the final chapter!,1
I've wanted these for a while then saw they were on sale,1
"loved the package and the easy way to watch and store this collection, always been a fan, and I really enjoyed best buy specials and easy to enjoy",1
"A must have for any Resident Evil enthusiast, With masive doses of Milla Jovovich to boot!",1
Great movie collection for the price. Would recommend for your collection.,1
Great trilogy on blu ray and the price was just right for this trilogy,1
"The best reason to watch this collection is seeing the beautiful Milla look tough and sexy in black leather. Great movies, too.",1
"These movies are much better on Blu ray than DVD, this is a set to get",1
I really enjoy the Resident Evil movies. I accept them for what they are. Extinction was probably my favorite of the bunch. This set is a great deal if you're a fan.,1
"I know these movies don't get good reviews, because, let's be honest, as a movie based on Resident Evil, it is awful. The RE lore isn't done well in these movies. However, as standalone zombie/action movies, they are great and entertaining. I love these movies and having the set is great. Can't wait for the finale this month!",1
Awesome collection and cheaper to get bluray then dvd version from other stores. Can't wait to watch the next installment later in the month.,1
I picked up The Resident Evil collection because at $14.99 it was just too good to pass up. This boxed set contains the first 5 RE movies in high quality Blue Ray and this is easily one of the most fun action/horror franchise ever created. What's also awesome is that each movie gets exponentially better than the last one.,1
"Very cheap for all 5 resident evils. Looks great. The fourth one is kinda cheesy. Got me ready for the new one. Plus, it's not on Netflix.",1
The entire series in one neat box. Worth it if your're a fan upgrading to Blueray.,1
Love these movies glad I found the whole set for anazong price,1
"This has been under my opinion one of the best sci-fi sagas of all time, it gets you hook since the very first scene , tons of action to watch again and again.",1
"I had never seen any of these movies, but a couple of my kids had. We enjoyed watching them together. The set made for an affordable and convenient Christmas present.",1
"I could not pass on this deal. 5 blu- ray movies for $15. With the final movie coming out, it was a no brainer that i had to buy this collection",1
The movies have great graphics and the box set is packaged nicely to fit on the shelf with the rest of my movies.,1
"This franchise I love very much,big fan of the games and the movies!!!!",1
I had great customer service I price matched this movie with frys electronics and got a good deal.,1
Not as good as the games but still cures boredom when needed.,1
"An enjoyable franchise, not greatly dissimilar to the Underworld franchise. Great world building overall.",1
My fianc�� introduced me to the Resident Evil franchise and I was not disappointed. I love that it takes up so much less space than the DVD set. We're slowly replacing all our DVD's and the picture quality is worth it.,1
"SAW THIS BOXED SET ,AN HAD TO HAVE IT, now i see theres a new RES. EVIL OUT END OF THE MONTH ,wonderful shes great !",1
Awesome collection but like every collection now there's a new one to add to it,1
I love the Resident evil franchise these movies are awesome.,1
This is a good series and it's fun and raw and great price,1
Great movie would recommend to a friend. Good price,1

I love all the Resident Evil movies. They were a well spent purchase.,1
Hours of action and thrill in this ver affordable collection!! Must have,1
I love the resident evil story line and for the price the box set is worth it,1
It saves you from buying all of the movies individually. The box set also looks really cool. It was a good buy.,1
The box is neat and for the price I couldn't refuse not buying the movies.,1
Another collection I bought. Great quality and great movie collection,1
I've always wanted the complete set of Resident Evil so this was perfect for me.,1
Pretty good deal for all of the movies on blu ray discs,1
Love the series and only had the first three so figured this was the better deal especially in blu-ray,1
Would highly recommend to any movie fans who likes this type of movie,1
"I love this boxset. I will admit however, that these movies get progressively worse towards end of series but I still love them.",1
All I have to say is 5 count 'em 5 Blu-Rays for $15 what makes it even better the Resident Evil movies are fun and enjoyable,1
I had been wanting this set for a while and with the new movies in theaters I just couldn't pass it up. The price was amazing and who doesn't love these movies!,1
Had to buy for the price and because the movies are great.,1
Glad they made all of them together can't wait for the new one,1
"If you're a long-time fan of the franchise or want to watch them for the first time, then this is collection you need! Not only does it come with the original blu-ray films, but it also comes with the digital copies of each film! Each film has its own blu-ray disc and case. The film cases are enclosed in one collectible, reflective sleeve, featuring the franchise's protagonist Alice. You can't go wrong with this set and it will definitely be a nice visual addition to your library.",1
"I was excited to see them whole collection on blu Ray but I patiently waited for it to go on sale. Once I saw it for $15, I bought it immediately. Amazing deal for the series!",1
Excellent movie I recommend it to everybody that wants to watch the movie you can't beat that price,1

"Action, stunts, and a fame fatal that kicks butt. All this adds to a great story line.",1
Excellent movie! I saw this movie in theaters. Hm.,1
Was really impressed at the sale price I got this set for - $10 less than even Amazon's sale price ! That being said Ive always been a big fan of the series and now its great to have the whole set! (well minus the final film thats about to come out,1
fun sci fi zombie flicks that are beyond belief but look great on the tv,1
Action from start to finish Milla Jovovich is such a good heroin love all the movies,1
Love these movies!!!Got them for a great price!!!!,1
Loved the series. Great bundle for any fan of the series and interest in the upcoming release.,1
Can't wait to see the new one. Have been a RE fan since thief first movie came out and am looking forward to the new ones.,1
Best way to catch up before the final chapter is released is to get the entire saga in 1 collection for a great price.,1
"Pretty good price for this set, with 5 movies included.",1
"I am a huge fan of these series and when I saw the whole collection in Blu Ray, I knew that I had to get them!",1

"I really enjoyed this movie, I have the entire collection",1
Great Deal on the collection of all five Resident evil films,1
I love these movies!! they are awesome and I'm glad I own them now,1
"I am a fan of these for how dumb they admit the story got, and the box set is fine good enough space, could be small or re-edition, but if you aren't a fan, look the other way (maybe Underworld?)",1
Great movie you guys should watch all of them highly recommend them,1
THE BEST FIVE MOVIES I EVER SEEN LOVED THEM ALL I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LOVES ZOMBIE MOVIES.,1

U cannot beat all of the resident evil movies for the price or the action,1
Great movie collection for fans f the Resident Evil series,1
I have never see the movies and seen that it was a great dark so snatched it up!,1
Enjoyed watching all the movies and did not think the price was bad either.,1
What a great deal all movies in a single collection.,1
Great picture. Very nice compact collection. I would recommend,1
Always been a fan of Resident Evil films and games. Glad to finally get the blu ray set. Graphics and special effects look great on the screen!,1
I have been a fan of the franchise since day one finally able to have the whole collection great deal,1
I've always been a resident evil and this set was grwat!,1
I love the movie series for resident evil! I love the fact you get 1-4. Plus it a perfect movie night!,1
Definitely will recommend this to all of my friends to watch,1
Love these movies and for the price i got all 5 what a bargain.,1
"Enjoyed the DVD set. DVD's were excellent, no problems and really liked being able to see all the movies together.",1
"Sweet collection at a bargain price. Really enjoyed it. This collection includes all five films, but it's missing the current film which is out as I write this. So it's incomplete. Still, this is a nice set at a decent price.",1
Got this set for $15 and couldn't be happier. Would recommend to any fan of action films.,1
Got five movies for the price of one. Lots of action in this set,1
I have seen only 2 of the Resident Evil movies in the series. Ready now to binge !!,1
"Complete in love, my favorite movie. A++I saw the same item, for too much money in Walmart. I get in Best Buy a ultra excelent deal.",1
I got this blu-ray DVDs set for my son for Christmas. We both love watching all the Resident Evil movies and it's even better in blu-ray!,1
Great collection at a great price and included digital copy for all the films,1
"If your a big fan of these movies like I am, this collection is a no brainer. $15 for a set that should be over $80 just can't beat the value.",1
This is a great package for the price. The movies are in individual cases. I thought that they were all in one case. It has a movie code for ultraviolet on newest movie. The code was expired but it did still work.,1
This was purchased for my husband and he enjoyed it.,1
This is a great collection of the Resident Evil films. I love how these movies have the perfect mixture of scary moments and great action. It has been fun watching Alice throughout these movies.,1
Was looking for a nice box set that had all the movies this did it.,1
This was a great buy for the price and its perfect anyones collection.,1
Bought the box set for my wife because she likes the resident evil movies,1
Nice collection at a great price. Big fan of the games and the movies are great as well,1
"I got this box set as a gift for my significant other and I think we both enjoy it equally. If you are a resident evil fan, this is a must have! It has all 5 movies on blu-ray and each disc has a ton of special features. Buying these movies individually would be more expensive and you wouldn't have a sweet box to put them in!I've seen all the Resident Evil movies and in my opinion, they are fantastic. Zombie action movies might not be for everyone, but they are for me! Alice is a badass and the action sequences are really awesome. If you like horror, action, and zombies, these movies will be right up your alley.",1
Such a good deal for five movies. It's obviously worth it.,1
Great package of movies for the price! It's great!,1

Great box set with digital copies included! Expired code but Sony accepted it.,1
I've been looking for this product for a long time and I'm very pleased with it,1
All five movies. Great for fans of resident evil!!,1
"Bought this pack for $15, includes the first 5 movies. Great deal, better prize than amazon.",1
"5 films for the price of one 3D blu-ray film. It is a steal. I only paid $29.99 at the time and it was something I was not about to pass up considering I enjoyed the RE films. People who are not hardcore RE fans may not enjoy these films as much because knowing the games allows the viewer to pick out little nostalgic pieces they threw into the films that were shown in the video games. The quality of the blu-rays are outstanding though. If you enjoyed the films or are simply a die-hard RE fan, get this. At this price, no matter what, you won't be disappointed.",1
"This is a pretty solid collection for the price. The films are strange, hovering somewhere between b-movie and AAA production, but somehow entertaining. Each disc has decent amount of special features, and the bluray picture and sound quality are top notch.",1
Couldn't pass this up at $14.99. The films are always fun.,1
Loved the resident evils was a great deal 4 15 dollars on blu ray,1
5 dics for 15 can't beat that even if i don't like some of them.,1
"I'm a huge movie collector and when I find STEALS like This I act quick! The RE movie set actually sold out more than once during the price break and they finally got it back in stock! Couldn't be happier with my purchase! Btw, it's all 5 movies in separate cases, which I wasn't expecting but love!",1
A great collection of films for a low price. Worth it.,1

"This is nice box set of the first 5 films and at a great price, loaded with special features and a great artwork on the covers as well as the box.

"If you are a fan of Resident Evil and do not have the movies yet, this is the set for you! Not only do you have the first 5 movies, but you also get the digital copies as well for what amounts to the price of just 2 of the movies on their own! While this diverges from the video games of the same name, the movies are a fun thrill ride with plenty of action!",1

To Have All The First Five Movies For One Low price. Can't beat it,1
Nice addition to my growing library of Blu-Ray movies. Price was really low for a brand new movie.,1
"For $15 I got the collection great deal, this set only came with 1 digital code for retribution.",1
This is an awesome collection of all the Resident Evil movies. This is the definitely the best group of movies.,1
5 movie collection box set for 14.99! That's an awsime price! Great item to own.,1
"first and foremost, unlike the other reviews you might read, this does NOT come with all the digital codes. For me, that mattered. I was bummed to see it only came with a code for retribution but at this price point, you really can't argue. All five movies are included. The movies progressively get worse but it's a zombie apocalypse movie and in the end, they're just mind numbingly fun. I'd watch them over and over again.",1
Great Box Set- We enjoyed these old classics over again!,1
I picked this up for 15$ right before the final chapter came out. Perfect time to buy,1
"I've always liked these movies, and this set got me all of them with a far cheaper price than buying them seperately.",1
Great buy for this 5 pack. Love this movie and it's sequels. Can't wait for the next new release.,1
The 5-Movie Resident Evil Collection (Resident Evil/Resident Evil:Apocalypse/Resident Evil:Extinction/Resident Evil: Retribution/Resident Evil:Afterlife)These movies are what they are and I enjoyed them very much. Look forward to every movie being more ridiculous than the next.,1

"With being a huge fan of the video games, buying this box set was a no brainer. And at that price..... Genius",1
"If you like the this movie series, then you defiantly should pick this up. Great way to catch up!",1
"I am glad I saw this when I did, my daughter took all the ones I purchased separately. Now I can binge watch and be ready for when the next one comes out on blu-ray.",1
I can't wait for the final chapter to come out. They we're all good movies.,1
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"It's such a good movie, even though; you disagree or not.. Its worth to watch..",1
The Resident Evil franchise is pure guilty pleasure. It's not meant to be taken seriously at all. Just enjoy the eye candy kicking zombie butt!,1
If you love action and sci-fi-fi then this is for you. Must have to complete your Resident Evil collection and to know the ending to this amazing story.,1
These movies are great on their own and packaged together they offer many hours of entertainment.,1
I love the resident evil franchise movie. Its very entertaining.,1

Bought all five of the first resident evil movies for $15!! And it came with a free ticket to see number seven!,1
I was looking for the whole movie collection for cheap price and I did and it was well worth the price,1
Now you can see Alice in all of her kick-a** glory in one place. Super great value price.,1
Nice to have all of the movies together in one place.,1
I'd been checking this out at Best Buy and it didn't come with the Ultraviolet copies. I was going to wait in hope for a new box set to come out with the upcoming release of the new Resident Evil. Then I went back and lo and behold the set came with the digital copies with no price increase. What a screaming deal at $14.99 for all five movies. I highly recommend you don't miss this one!,1
"Very nice set for the money, just have to wait for the last one to come out",1
Nothing like having the whole collection of resident evil! All fought up now to watch the movie in theathers,1
Picked this collection up for a steal of a price. Had all 5 films in individual cases.,1
What a price for this collection ! These movies are great,1
All in all this is a very entertaining series of movies that SciFi and Fantasy buffs will (should) enjoy.,1
"Great way for fans of the series to get their hands on all of the Resident Evil movies to prep them for the latest installment. Even if you already own a couple of the titles, the price of this set to own them all in Blu-Ray format is a no brainer. Grab your favorite snacks and drinks, crank up the surround sound, and settle down on your couch for a marathon of Alice!",1
These movies are just so awesome. I love to watch them over and over again. So much action.,1
"My review, this is the best video game to movie franchise. with only mortal combat coming n second. They did a great job with all 5 movies so far. cannot wait until the final chapter is delivered to my house",1
I have these on dvd and saw the blue rays on sale. I went ahead and upgraded; especially as low cost as they are. Alice is awesome!,1
"Classic movies in Blu-Ray. The price is right, especially since the new movie is released on DVD next week. Perfect time to catch up and get ready for the new release.",1
Great price for the five films on Blu-Ray-- discounted at under $15 bucks! Can't wait for the final film in the series coming out next week and I'll binge watch all 6 films!,1
FINALLY GOT THIS WHEN i WAITED FOREVER TO GET IT ON BLURAY. AND ITS WORTH IT. THE RESOLUTION UPGRADE IS GREAT!,1
Got the entire set for $15! Less than 3 dollars a movie!,1
Very happy this is a great series which I have watched many times. I is convienent to have all in one box,1
"5 movies for 15 dollars, really good deal. Make sure each package had different movies. Seen one with double movies",1
Perfect for the fan of blow stuff up and turn off my brain.,1
"I'm a fan of the Resident Evil franchise. I was at BB and saw this Blu-Ray 5 disc set on sale. Since the new ""Final Chapter"" was just released on DVD, it was time to add the entire series in Blu-Ray to my video library.",1
Super series. The franchise is great start to finish. Can not beat the price.,1
Go to this movie set super cheap. Hadn't seen all of them but they were all good movies! Great price!!,1
definitely a good deal! These came with a code for downloading them too!,1
I am a big fan of this series. Definately worth the money for the bluray set.,1
Great series last one just came out as a separate movie,1
Great deal. All five movies on bluy ray plus all five digitally. If you like series get it.,1
"Excellent value, Great movie Series, excellent Action",1
These are fun movies for a rainy day. You can't pass up all 5 blu-rays in one package for a cheap price!,1
"I am very happy with this bundle, the blue-ray discs come with full features and the digital download which makes this a steal.",1
I will watch any movie where I can see mills jovovichs body.,1
This is a great collection at a great price and its in blu-ray!,1
This was an awesome deal for the 5 disc set on blu-ray. I was super stoked because mine included an expired vudu code that should have quit working 3 years ago but it was still good so I was able to add the entire bundle to my online library. Plus these movies are so great. Over the top action and blood and gore. Very well done.,1
A great series. The 5th one was a bit weak but still enjoyable,1
Good sci-fi/zombie movie series based off the popular video game. Has good action and special effects.,1
We buy movies all the time and so when we got the opportunity to get them all minus the final one we took it. Great sci fi collection with action all over.,1
"I started watching the original movie because I am a fan of Michelle Rodriguez (who appears throughout the series). The sequals continued to expand from the source video game stories & characters, delightfully blending sci-fi, horror, action, suspense and even comedy! Over-the-top action delivers in a steady build!",1
"If you're even just a casual fan of the franchise, how can you not love the5 movie pack plus the digital downloads? The price point was crazy cheap. There's really not a single negative thing to say about it. Watch the movies, enjoy the franchise, and add it to your collection.",1
These movies are fun and for the price I couldn't pass it up. They are great quality too.,1
Is the most complete trilogy of Resident Evil.Buyed now.,1
Well the killings continue and yes she is a looker still. A must have to complete the collection of the series,1
I saw this bundle on Vudu and it was 3x as much! This was a great value for the film franchise!,1
Been a Resident Evil fan since the game series started. Picked up for $15 on sale! Awesome!,1
Bought these for my daughter for less than 15$ and she loved it.,1
Very good series film. Hope they make more. like the action.,1
I got this box set at an awesome price. I'm assuming they marked it down because there is probably a new box set coming with the release of the final RE movie. Buy these before they're gone. It doesn't get any cheaper than this.,1
I'd been looking at this box set for a while and when it went on sale for $15 I jumped on it. 5 bluray movies for $15? Yes please! All the movies play great and each came packaged in their own case. Great deal!,1
Can't beat this box set for the price! Great movies if you like a popcorn flick with a lot of action!,1
if you liked all the Resident Evil movies this collection has the first 5 on blue-ray for $15 a great value. I bought this 5 movie collection and #6 and it was $10 cheaper than purchasing the 6 movie collection. Awesome!,1
i got all 5 movies for 14.99 this is a great deal.,1
These may not be classic cinema but they are a lot of fun to watch. 5 films bundled together at a great price is too hard to pass up,1
I got this set for a really great price and would recommend to anyone!!,1
I DECIDED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW TO HELP PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE DIGITAL HD FACTS. WHEN I OPENED THE BOX SET(EACH BLU-RAY IS PACKAGED IN IT'S OWN BOX) THERE WAS AN ULTRAVIOLET CODE PAPER INCLUDED. IT SAID TO GO TO SONYPICTURES TO REDEEM. INSTEAD I WENT TO MY VUDU ACCOUNT AND ENTERED THE CODE. I RECEIVED ALL FIVE MOVIES IN HD. THE PLASTIC WRAP ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOXED SET SAID YOU WOULD GET ALL 5 MOVIES WITH 1 CODE. THE OFFER EXPIRED ON12/21/2014 BUT WORKED ANYWAY. IF YOU DON'T GET YOUR DIGITAL COPIES I WOULD SUGGEST CONTACTING SONY. AS FAR AS REVIEWING THE MOVIES WHAT CAN I SAY? FANTASTIC!!!!!,1
"I was always looking to get the collection and this was an amazing deal, so happy with it plus all in blue ray? Perfect!",1
Resident Evil collection all in one... enough said! You don't find any better deal.,1
If you like zombie movies you must watch this awesome collection!,1
If you're looking to buy this collection you already know that you like the films. Its well worth the purchase and you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it.,1
"Already had first few RE movies, love the blue ray experience and was already sold when I first saw this blue ray bundle. All movies are individually packaged and have original covers from when they first came out. Good buy for 15 when individual they can run from 5 to $10.",1
"Already own on DVD, but Movie looks great on Blu Ray",1
A great bundle with all the movies. This was a decent movie definitely worth checking out.,1
Own all of the previous Resident Evil movies except the Final Chapter. A great choice for real collectors of movies and of Resident Evil. Each movie comes in its own case as if you were to buy them individually with another case to hold them all together.,1
Love this movie collection. Will probably add the newest movie too.,1
I've always loved the games the movies are just as great!!!!,1
I'm a huge fan and needed them upgraded to blurays. Great price,1
"Picked this up on the cheap side and, although Ultraviolet copy stated it had long since expired, much to my delight it was still available. Not as big of a fan of the 4th/5th films (it clearly has run it's course and got too caught up in being 3D), I do like the set and the 1st and 3rd movies are worth what was paid for the entire set.",1
This is a very good bonset of a great seriea. Many great special features as well,1
"Dope movies, although I wasn't a fan of the movies so much, it's a typical blockbuster for people. Logan was a solid movie.",1
Love these movies!!! Mila is great in every movie!!!,1
"If you're a fan of the resident evil game's, then you probably already love the movies. It's a great complete run of the first 5 movies at a very reasonable price. Despite the low price for 5 blu rays they didn't cut out any of the bonus features. Which my wife loved.",1
My wife and I love watching these movies together.,1
Nice collection of movies. Spent the weekend watching all the movies,1
Best buy really nailed it offering this disc set. It's affordable and the movies speak for themselves. Highly recommend adding this set to your collection. The blu ray quality of these movies is fantastic.,1
Got this bundle when it was on sale. Got all the movies in one place.,1
Good series with non-stop zombie action. Would highly recommend it.,1
"Excellent, resident evil is really good. Great actors to.",1
I'm a huge Resident Evil fan either the video game or movies and this is a great collection of each movie 1-5.,1
I loved the newest one but from being able to watch all from disc number 1-5 I can tell how the plot line goes and it makes more sense. I highly recommend this if your into action it really gets you wanting to watch more.,1
Great movies glad they come out with this one as a set.,1
"If you love a great Zombie type apocalypse series, you will love this. I have watch majority of these movies at the theater. The last movie sealed it all up. It was a great ending.",1
Great price for all five films! Great to binge watch in preparation of part six!,1
"This was a great series. I already owned a couple of the blu-rays of the series, and now I own the whole collection.",1
I've always been a huge Resident Evil fan so picking up these in a bundle was a great find!,1
I love zombie movies. The resident evil series is one of the best. Sometimes it's a little corny but that is what movies are for to be intertaining and make things that are not real into real things on the screen.,1
Purchased this when the last movie came out for twenty bucks and enjoyed it very much. The films came with download codes. They looked great!,1
Great collection of movies if you like resident evil. If not.. you will prob hate it.,1
Simply love these movies! So full of action and suspense.,1
"if you have not seen any of these movies, this is the perfect way to do so",1
"If u enjoy action fighting movies, you will love this! Not to mention, ZOMBIES! I like that it is a collection pack because it's more worth it instead of buying one movie at a time.",1
This collection is amazing. A must buy if you are a resident evil fan! :),1
Awesome deal great movies !!!! I wish they would've done more with the 4th movie,1
"Who doesn't love Resident Evil? And a box set that costs less than buying one movie by it's self, who would hesitate to buy that?",1
"love the movies, some more some less, but a unbeatable price even if you don't like a couple of them",1
"Love the movies and enjoy the high quality, and the fact that i can download in my tablet",1
"The Resident Evil series is great, tons of action and a great plot lines!",0
Epic as always! Each film gets better and better! Star Wars... Matrix... And Resident Evil,0
excellent movies each one is better than the last .,1
Already 5 sequels and many more to come. There is a large fanbase out there for this Resident Evil franchise and I am truly one of them. Great cinematography and excitingly intense movie.,1
"This five disc Blu-Ray set has the best of the best of any collection. The action throughout all five movies is always an edge of the seat show. You gotta have a large bowl of popcorn, sit back, relax and watch Milla Jovovich entertain you from beginning to end. I'm extremely glad to have bought this from Best Buy to add to my collection.",0
The 5 movie Resident Evil Movie pack contains all the movies as well as UV code for all 5 movies.,0
Great Savings in one box set!!! Love the movies and Milla. All Connect together very well and great extra features.,0
Just what I wanted all the movies in one box..just wish it had the last movie in 3d but o well,1
"This series is fun to watch. Lot's of action as well as plausible plot.You can watch the entire series of movies without getting bored, and a fun thing to do on a very snowy day.",0
big fan of the franchise and it was a lot cheaper than buying them separately.,1
"I know not everyone is a fan of the RE movies, but I have to say my girlfriend and I can't seem to get enough of them. Are they cheesy? Yes. Do they have serious plot holes? Sure. Regardelss the action is great and I can't wait for the next movie after watching each one. My favorite thing about them is they just keep going, they barely ever pause to elaborate on any plot points.",1
"Great action movies! Blu-ray is absolutely beautiful! Story line is ok, but I doubt you'll purchase this for the story line. Great thing is you don't have to be a fan of the video games to enjoy. But if you are a fan, this is a no-brainer. Buy it now!",1
i score on this product... all resident evil in one package ... 5 blu-ray for lower price.,1
Well the movies are not the best but I am a big video game fans. All these movie in one big box is a great deal! So if you are a resident evil video game fan. You got to have it for collecting purpose.,0
Very good movie. We enjoyed it very much and would purchase more from Best Buy.,1
"Awesome move, great story and superb action. With this price and quality its well worth it.",1
"Al five of the first resident evil movies for less than $20! Does not include the last movie, but a great deal overall",1
"The Resident Evil series is a fun shoot 'em up sci-fi series. You know exactly what you'll get. Lots of guns. Lots of zombies. Sometimes lots of Mila too! And a story that is fun to follow from the beginning. You can't go wrong with this box set although if you wait, they might release the complete series box set soon now that the series is officially over. It was a sad day when I watched the last movie in theaters.",1
And you're these movies very much wish they keep the franchise going,1
I love it love the packaging love all five movie hopefully I'll get that next one,1
I enjoy these movies and when I went to the store to buy the last movie they had these in blu ray and I upgraded my movies from DVD,1
My fianc introduced me to the Resident Evil franchise and I was not disappointed. I love that it takes up so much less space than the DVD set. We're slowly replacing all our DVD's and the picture quality is worth it.,1
"If you're a resident Evil fan, this is the set for you. All the movies for one low price.",1
I was impressed with the picture and quality of the bluray. Great sound. Great picture.,0
"Not only the BD, but now have them in VuDu as well. I'm set!",0
I'd been shopping around for this set for awhile and the price with it being bluray I couldn't turn it down. I would highly recommend this for any comic book/video game nerds just looking for a box set to binge watch through.,1
Love these movies and this was a great deal.,0
"5 movies on Blu Ray for about 3 a piece. Doesn't matter if you think these movies are Good or bad, it's worth buying especially at that price.",1
great movies,0
love the movie,0
Good price,0
Anyone who knows Milla knows how sexy she is period. These movies are not groundbreaking nor Oscar worthy but definitely some cool action movies for fans of the game or just action junkies in general and of course the ever so loveable zombies which you can't leave out. I recommend this collection worth every penny!,1
"Love all of the action, horror and the plot.",0
great,0
There are little on the dry side but it's up to you to try them,1
"I have bought 100 of these, online or when Im walking around in the store. They are amazing !",1
We buy these for our daughter and she loves them! She feels like a big girl but is safe to eat these gluten free bars. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
Thanks for making a bar gluten free that my daughter can not only eat but absolutely loves as well.,0
Finally a granola bar that is GF but still tastes like a chocolate chip granola bar!!!,0
My kids love it...,0
"If you must be gluten free and are looking for a good snack bar you can toss in your purse or pocket, this is it. Good flavor and texture and a handy size...they are one of my favorites.",1
I am normally in my favoerite store weekly. I needed this product each of those weeks and the shelves were empty. I was forced to order on line which should not have happened. I am a little disapointed but will survive.,0
not bad just does not impress,0
ok !,1
Works great and holds all day. I wish it was easier to remove.,0
It lasts all day. Has a good flavor.,0
Use this product all the time,1
I have tried different types of glue for protesis but this is the best one.,1
Will order it again,1
"Nothing else has worked this well! All the powder only holds until I try to do something,,,you know, like EAT! I put this on early in the morning, and they stayed tight, and kept food out all day long! Now I can go out to dinner again without carrying spare powder.",1
Prefer this to zinc free with no flavor. this product is softer and holds better. Would recommend to users.,1
If you use this more then once a day then this is a great deal. Thomas P,1
"I've used every dental adhesive out there and this is the only one I will choose from now on. It differs from all the rest like this: 1) It tastes pretty good for goop in your mouth. 2) It keeps teeth exactly where they belong for at least 3 days longer than ANY other product of this kind. 3) It is a good price for what it does and a super value too. 4) It lasts longer than the others probably because I don't have to use as much to do the job. 5) Its pink! 6) It applies evenly and neatly (BIG difference there) and comes off simply when washed. Being the BEST value is a good enough reason for choosing this one only however, with all its other plusses, it is a no-brainer to continue buying this brand and type always. I highly recommend.",0
Used to use Freedent until I heard and saw that it contained zinc. Discovered the poligrip I use does not. Like the Ultra Fresh better than the plain.,0
Great product it's the best on the market,0
"I have partials, uppers and lowers. They are starting to slip a bit, so I use this goo. I used a very small strip in the front. Works great and tastes minty fresh.",0
Works well.,1
it was for my hubby and he loved it.,0
Have no trouble holding dentures last a long time.,0
Finally someplace that shipped what I ordered. I ordered this twice before from other places and got the wrong item and had to return it. Thank You Walmart for getting it right on the first try!,1
I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT THIS IS THE SLOWEST SHIPPING I HAVE EVER SEEN I AM STILL WAITTING FOR THE PRODECT,0
I liked this it,1
it all I use to help me keep my dentures secure.,1
It works wonderful,1
"Wow! This REALLY keeps a good grip on my lower partial, no worries about it slipping.",1
Opened box n bamboo plant had a weird smell. Almost like urine. I decided to air it out n arrange the plant's limbs n see if in a few days the odor would subside. It did ! I haven't returned it because it's just too much work so it's in a corner in my living n I'm just trying to get use to it. Next time I will shop in person n buy a real plant. Not worth the price.,1
The tree itself is very nice. Not as full as I expected but I still love it. Completes the look of my tropical paradise. The only reason I gave 4 stars is it took a very long time for me to receive it. It was on backorder for almost 2 months.,1

The show is unique. I'll give it that. But just not the Sci-Fi show for me.,1
"Not bad for futuristic show. Has some shortcomings, however good plot and shot of America are great. Still the characters, since they where adolescents, it was hard to believe that they ONLY they would be sent to try and establish ""living"" on earth without any other older characters.",1
Another series about what can happen after the apocolapse,1
A decent science fiction television series. Worth watching,1
Another good show from the CW I enjoy the story and the plot.,1
The first season is a bit rocky and over the top typical teen drama but once you get past the first half it really picks up. Season 2 is even better but after that it goes down hill fast. Much wasted potential.,1
An engaging and entertaining show. Well worth the buy.,1
This series is interesting and keeps you watching until the end. It was a great way to catch up with the series so we can watch season 2.,1
"I liked the first season. Great characters, and story.",1
This show is quite entertaining to watch. Good cast and action.,1
Juvenile delinquents fight for survival in a Post-apocalyptic world.,1
"Great quality, wonderful customer service, good price",1
i like the show and this way i have something to watch in the summer.,1
This is one of those shows were it's better to watch all at once.,1
one of the best T.V. Shows I have ever seen in the last year,1
Not a bad sci-fi series especially since its from the cw. The story line is kind of dumb but there is action and so many love triangles it's hard to keep everything straight. I only wish it could have been on a better network like amc or hbo.,1
I had to really power thru those first few episode but once I did I was rewarded with a great show. I love that it has great representation and makes you think.,1
Overall a good series. I did not see this when it was on but now have it scheduled to record.,1
Interesting Sci Fi show. Worth watching for sci fi fans.,1
I Enjoy the young cast of the show. To show how their survival modes kick in on this show. Very well written.,1
"The 100 is a post apocalyptic sci-fi offering that has many elements typical of the genre. We start off about 100 years after the surface of the Earth was destroyed in an atomic war. Thirteen nations have orbital space stations and when the thirteenth is destroyed a truce is eventually called and the remaining station unite physically forming the Ark, what is presumed to be the last remnant of the human race. The Ark has a very dysfunction society were all crimes are punished by execution (floated out of an airlock). Juvenile offenders are reviewed at age of 18 and may be spared. Out story opens with Clarke being taken out of juvenile detention to be sent to Earth to see if the planet can support life, since the Ark is dying. Many elements of the first few episodes borrow from the Lord of the Flies and other science fiction works. The 100 find out in a matter of a few episodes that they are indeed not alone on the planet and the situation worsens on the Ark when over 300 people are ""removed from the life support grid"" which is polite language for them to be killed to allow the remaining people to live. The culling was voluntary but along with the political fighting that was shown and death of likable main characters revealed a very dark undertone at times in the series. The dark undertone was similar to Stargate Universe. We are left at the end of the season with the remnants of the 100 being taken to what appears to be a surviving military bunker. The ending of the first season has a deja vu appearance similar to Jeremiah season one. Overall a good sci-fi effort but only combines elements already seen in the genre with no new ground breaking plot or story lines so far. Look forward to season two. Blu Ray picture quality is excellent.",1
Excellent show with interesting characters and fast paced story line.,1
The 100 series is a good TV series to watch and follow.,1
"Reasonable priced, fast delivery service and secured packaging. Can't wait for season 2 to come out.",1
Great movie for people who like sci-fi movies. Bought for my son,1
CW seems to have a good handle on concept series. This is set in the future where the future of humanity are living in a space state after a nuclear war. 100 juvenile delinquents are sent back to earth to see if they can survive and repopulate the earth. Interesting dynamics and mysteries between the people on the station vs earth.,1
An interesting plot and engaging characters make this show a cut above the usual CW fare. It's a binge-worthy trip you'll be glad you took.,1
This season is amazing nuclear power bomb that we'll written.,1
Both unflinchingly brutal but all to human this post apocalyptic thrill ride is well worth the the investment!,1
"This TV Series is a real good show to watch, from start to finish.",1
Look past that its another teen apocalypse story and it actually is pretty good and keeps you engaged in the story line.,1
Action galore. Grabs your attention and holds onto it.,1
I liked this show from beginning to end. Lots of suspense,1
Just was just the beginning. What a fresh ifea to come to tv,1
This show is a of a kind. The cast is new and once you start watching you can't stop.,1
Fun show to watch when the series started. Keeps you interested.,1
We missed the first season. I'm glad we were able to purchase the 1st Season DVD. Wow it was fantastic.,1
I found this to be a refreshingly good series. Good acting and storyline. Going to buy season 2 and hope it keeps up,1
Great show hope this one runs for a while good story line and good actors,1
Finally a show that can keep me interested for more than just a half hour.,1
A group of 100 criminal teens get sent to earth from a space station . It gets better with each episode. The blu ray of this looks fabulous on my 50 inch plasma. Need to find the rest of the series on Blu ray.,1
I have liked The 100 since the beginning. There is no shortage of drama and action.,1
Excellent quality Blu-ray set.,0
Excellent price for an amazing show. Also comes with digital hd which it doesnt state but was a definent plus.,1
"This DVD set arrived in a timely manner, and so far I am enjoying this series. I look forward to watching more.",1
"Disk, show is very good, hope it last for many seasons. Shipping pass is wonderfull!!!",1
"CW nailed it again with another great series. Suspensful, mysterious and dramatic show kept me wanting to watch another episode as soon as I finished the episode I was on.",1
"Wasn't expecting this show to be that great, but I really like it...I have enjoyed it from the start! Can't wait to see what season 2 has in store for us!",1
"Not a bad way to get rid of people who will not conform to the ""MAN"". :-)",1
Everyone needs to go get this show and watch it. It gets better and better as the seasons progress which usually doesn't happen with many TV shows. Most shows the seasons tend to get a little worse until the show is canceled but not this show.,1
"It's nice to have something other than zombies destroying the world for once and I think the show will be on for a while. I haven't watched the CW in years, but found this show to be entertaining.",1
"I have watched the first season on TV every week when the new one came on and so I had to buy the season when it came out, it's a really good series and it's different in many ways then others.",1
"This is a great series, well thought of and very original, I was disappointed when I found out that they were going to cancel it. They always cancel good shows and keep garbage like ""the bachelor"" on the air, but the network brought it back for an even better second season, and the third is coming too. Awesome show.",1
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my mother, and was very happy with the product received.",1
My picky adult boy likes this series so it must be good!,1
Story about populating earth again after nuclear war. It is highly rated!,1
"Great new show, great story with mixture of space, apocalyptic surrounding and survival. Great extras as well",1
Great series and enjoyed catching up. can wait to own them all.,1
This show is an amazing rollercoaster of edge of your seat thrills and crazy twists and turns--you'll never see what's coming but you'll enjoy every second of it.,1
"I got into this show when I ran out of things on netflix. I'm not usually a fan of shows from the CW because they are usually kind of terrible, or at least not great. I liked the idea of this show though. Kids get sent to a future earth where it is supposed to be uninhabitable. Definitely worth a try!",1
I first watched this on Netflix streaming looking for something new and was hooked. Had to buy it.,1
"The 100 is like a fine wine: it's a show that only gets better with age. Although the first few episodes seem like typical CW-fare, the emotional stakes and characters continue to develop with each subsequent episode. The story beings when 100 juvenile delinquents are sent down from their space station to the war torn earth, to see if it is inhabitable many years after a nuclear apocalypse. Questions of morality, survival, sacrifice, and cultural politics are the central themes in the first season, and continue on for the rest of the show. The 100 dares to ask questions that other shows are too scared to even acknowledge. It's worth your time, for sure.In my opinion, the blu-ray release is the way to watch this show. With a gorgeous picture quality and an impressive audio track, you will get the most bang for your buck with this release. All 13 episodes from the first season are included in this set. But don't worry because season two is already out to marathon after you finish that intense and shocking cliffhanger at the end of the first season.",1
I bought this set as a Christmas gift to my sister and ended up watching the whole season with her.,1
I heard good things about this movie and I wasn't disappointed.,1
I love this new series. Please keep making these for many seasons.,1
Great series on blu ray! Been wanting it for a while now. Can't wait for the second season!,1
I couldn't wait till I could buy the entire season. Normally I wouldn't buy an entire season of any show. But I have to say this is the only tv series I have not had any bored moments of hurry up to some action than am interested in again.,1
"I didn't know anything about this series when I purchased it. I thought the write-up on the back sounded good and seemed like something I would like. Just finished the 6th episode last night and it keeps getting better. If you like this sort of thing, you should enjoy!",1
Lot of action keeps you watching to the very end of the season,1
I enjoyed watching the season again. This program is very inventive and unique,1
My friend and I watched this entire show when it first aired and then purchased it and watched it all again just in time for season 2 to start. We love this show! This show has a little bit of romance/action/adventure/futuristic style to it if you like any combo of the aforementioned you will love this show!,1
Very nice first season I cant wait for the s3cond part,1
Great show at a great price. BestBuy still has the best deals.,1
Great show!!! A MUST GET FOR EVERY FAN OUT THERE!!!,1
If your looking for a show that changes it up you'll like this one,1
My son really enoyed it! We would recommend to all that like these kind of serious.,1
"The 100 is well worth any sci-fi fan���s time, going all-in on its big concept and the many crisis that face its characters, both above and on the ground.",1
I didn't know what to expect from this show. I watched the first episode really enjoyed it and proceeded to read the book. Which I know now was a mistake and almost put me off the show but after starting episode two I ended up binging on the rest of the series. It's exciting and filled with a good looking and acting cast.,1
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this show when I first saw a trailer for it, but season 1 was one of my favorite shows in recent memory. Really happy to have it on my shelf so I can marathon whenever I want.",1
"Very good show. I like it a lot. Very good, thanks best buy.",1
It's a great way to catch up on the entire season couldn't take my eyes off of the DVDs they did a great job and it was reasonably priced it's the only place I could find it by it while you can!,1
"This show is very well done and so far beyond what I would ever expect a show from CW to be like. Arrow, Flash, the 100..no wonder nobody watches nbc, cbs, or abc.",1
"love this show, full of action and the making of it was great!",1
Great price for a blu Ray and overall great show!!,1
Another of CWs under the radar series. This is a great dysotopia series that fans of the genre will certainly enjoy. This is a can't miss show!,1
This is a great show. Sort of like a cross between lost and a space show. Great characters and acting.,1
"The sentient bananas were a little weird, but still",1
"Superb plot development elevated what could have been typical CW teen angst fare. Great SFX and worldbuilding made every new episode an improvement. No surprise really, given the presence of Jae Marchant, a former Dr. Who producer.",1
"takes a bit to get going, but it is highly entertaining",1
"I simply love it... You have to watch it.... First episode, I was hooked unto it, and can not stop wanting for more..",1
This is a better television show than I thought. Great DVD!,1
"Great series on the CW, Full of twists and turns..",1
i really love the show and hope that the next season is even better than the first.,1
Great show. Nice that it comes with a digital copy.,1
"It's a CW show so everyone is beautiful, but don't judge this show as just a bunch of pretty people. There is a lot going on and you can really have some complex issues to think about.",1
Awesome show !Like how they took the premise of Lord of the Flies and made it into this show.Season ended with a great twist.,1
"I don't understand the varied reviews of this show. The ""100"" are juvenile delinquents released from their space station prison sentences to populate a radiated earth: earth is most likely not habitable. But down they go, and when they get to earth they not only experience a ""planet"" for the first time, but they also have just been released from prison. So imagine, 100 irresponsible criminals get dropped on an earth that hasn't seen a human in 97 years; you might expect to see some strange behavior and you do. The setting is pretty awesome, the characters are interesting and unless the writers completely drop the ball on the story, then you can expect a pretty good show. Also note, all the bad reviews have come from people who have just seen a single episode (who's expectations were probably unrealistic in the first place). This is one of the better pilots I have seen.",0
I watched the show when it aired on the CW and had to have it on DVD! I really love all the characters!,1
I will not give the shows plot away.in the top 10 best shows on tv. not better than some of the shows on hbo but very very good story line and picture is a 10,1
I would recommend watching it. It's an entertaining movie to watch.,1
"Great show,good acting. It's just a good show from the beginning.",1
"I love sci-fi ��� and this show caught my attention. I would compare this show to be similar to Lost (which I also love), and Lord of the Fries. The characters are believable, even the ""bad guys"" ��� the desperation and their willingness to do whatever it takes to survive made that show more exciting. There are times that I actually had to pause to gather my nerve before I continued watching. The plot twists, here and there, made it more exciting. I know this is a TV show and not real life, I do feel sorry for the characters that they have to fend for themselves. I watched the original on Netflix, and now I have the opportunity to get a Blu-ray copy. (I did buy the DVD version of this, but I believe the compression rate was set too high, and there were parts that were pixelated.) I am hoping for the second season to go on sale, and I will buy that, too. If a sci-fi show with younger characters is for you, you will not be disappointed.",1
I really enjoyed this series. I watched it on Netflix and seen it on sale one day and purchased and started rewatching.,1
"I was not aware this was even a show until my wife had purchased this series. I had seen it in passing through the room she was watching it in, but never gave it a chance until later.It is a great show about the human power struggle of survival at almost any means necessary. This is a good show that does not have to base everything around drugs or violence. Though there is a fair bit of violence.",1
"Quick delivery, incredible price, and great for anyone who like psychological thrillers. There is action, romance, sci-fi, and the theme of difficult decisions to survive. There is something for everyone here!",1
"Would highly recommend the first and second season of ""The 100""",1
"Definitely a YA show but its pretty interesting, plot is rather simple but not too boring. Thinking about getting second season when it goes on sale.",1
"I love this show. Great plot, characters, and scenery.",1
Amazing series altogether on all different levels of science fiction things.,1
Awesome series about the future. Must see! Very well done.,1
"Keeps you wanting more, I just keep wanting to watch the next episode or season",1
Great price. Digital copy make the Blu-Ray worth it. Must see tv. Leaves you wanting more each season.,1
Great science fiction series. I will definitely pick up the other seasons when they go on sale,1
Kinda heavy on teen drama but it's a fun campy show that has some pretty intense plot twists and quality television beyond what you would expect.,1
"I found this at a price that could not be passed up . The fact that it was in blu Ray and included Digital copy clinched it for me. Not only did I get Best buy member points, But Best Buy sometimes have promotions running under Mypoints that give up to 3000 Mypoints for in store purchases. I received 200 for buying The 100.",1
"I had never even seen this show when I bought it from Best Buy, but I took a chance on it since it was at such a great price. I am very happy I took that chance, as it's now one of my favorite TV shows currently airing! The show looks and sounds amazing on Blu-ray, and I can't wait to pick up the next two seasons on Blu-ray as well.",1
Bough it on sale here and love to finally have this set! I love it,1
One of the better tv shows on at the moment. Even my mom likes it which is amazing for a show with action and sci-fi,1
great season and cast story line is amazing would watch again and again,1
"Going in, I expected another run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic teen drama. Well, it is that to some degree, but the writing so much better than the majority of what's out there. You grow to love characters that you originally disliked, and even become repulsed by a few of the likeable ones. Just as in real life, a character's actions can have deadly serious repercussions, but he or she may never actually see the consequences first hand. Main characters are constantly being muddied and bloodied physically and mentally, and at the end of the day the ramifications are real and none of them are above being killed off. When this realization sinks in, it truly makes for some very tense moments.",1
"I binged watch both seasons in 2 days, suspenseful, exciting, and action packed series!!",1
"My daughter and I watched it and we got hooked really quick. We watch shows like the originals, vampire diaries, walking dead, under the dome, defiance, revolution. Highly recommended",1
"This has become one of my favorite series to watch on TV, the cast of people complement each to make a very enjoyable show.",1
I loved this movie. Can not wait for the follow-up seasons to be released. This is a Full Throttle movie,1
If you love Science Fiction show then this is for you!!,1
"II'm not into TV shows but this one rocks, the characters are ones you can get to know. As the series progresses thru you ask yourself whats next the episodic style is awesome compared to the random episodes a lot of series do.. I recommend this show to anyone who wants to enjoy a good story and since this is only season 1 you'll b e like me at the end wanting to buy the next season to continue the adventure.",1
I loved this series so much I have purchased every season that comes out.,1
One of the best post apocalyptic series I've seen in a while.,1
One of the best t.v. shows out there. The stories are super exciting and really have you get involved. Great all around.,1
A post atomic world left from the ravages of nuclear extinction. A story of survivors trying to survive the world as it now is. A great bing watching series...,1
I was really pleasantly surprised how good this show is considering the books that it came from. Save yourself the time and skip the books and just watch the show. In fact I'd call it a must watch if you like either The Walking Dead or the The Road,1
Very suspenseful and edge of your seat show. I have not had much time to watch it but I like what I have seen.,1
"Such an awesome show, glad I found it to add to my collection.",1
"Season 1 is easily the best of the 3 seasons so far in my opinion. This bluray is excellent and is the first season of ""100"" youths exiled to a nucleur waste laden Earth (set in the not-to-distant future).",1
"Love this Series, getting the other two seasons no",1
Great series with a lot of action and drama. Definitely worth watching.,1
One of my favorite tv series I finally found on blu ray and at a decent price.,1
"I love sci-fi  and this show caught my attention. I would compare this show to be similar to Lost (which I also love), and Lord of the Fries.

"The 100 is well worth any sci-fi fans time, going all-in on its big concept and the many crisis that face its characters, both above and on the ground.",1
"Love this product as it is not greasy and heavy feeling. The brown bottles seem to have a better scent than the white, waterproof bottles. For me, still the best product.",1
"I've looked and looked, so glad I finally found this product, it is awesome.",1
For me this is the best suntan lotion on the market.,1
I use this product all season long. Keeps my skin moistured This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"A friend recommended Austrailian Gold to me 4 years ago because my other lotion was causing rashes. No rashes with AG, and I will never use another tan lotion product.",1
I have used this for years but can't find the SPF 4 on the shelves unless it has bronzer in it. The bronzer is messy and stains. This one doesn't make a mess or stain.,1
I have been using this lotion for several years. So glad I can buy it online as it is not in stores.,1
I Love this product cannot find it anywhere so I decided to go directly to the website.. It was delivered in a timely fashion as well.. I'm very happy!,1
"My family and I use this so much! It has great coverage, along with a tan, and smells great every spring break we stock up, but it never lasts!",1
I have used this since I was in 8th grade and still continue to. It is the best smelling lotion out there!,1
"I love this product, but disappointed that I can't find it any place but on your website. keep this product!!!",1
"I have used this tanning lotion for years, it has the best smell and keeps your skin soft.",1
This is the best product ever and is only available here,1
We love this lotion! The best smelling lotion on the market!!!!!,1
have been using SP4 for years wouldn't consider anything else,1
I am very pleased with this purchase. I cannot find this in any stores so I am happy that I can purchase this online.,1
I became a fan of Australian Gold years ago in Florida - it was not available at that time in CT so I managed to order it on line. Recently I notice this brand is in most discount and drug stores - but 4 is not so I looked at your website and delighted to see the array of products. I tan easily and 4 is just perfect for me - I get some protection and a very golden tan.,1
"This is silky-smooth, easily absorbed sunscreen lotion with a light and fresh fragrance. My hubby loves it even more than I do and uses it more than I do!",1
I have been buying Australian Gold since around 1990 I believe. It's been so long I can't remember when I started buying it. It is the only lotion I will buy. I bought another kind way back when and I broke out in a rash and my face swelled up. Since using Australian Gold this has never happened. It keeps my skin moist and soft and I never feel dried out after being in the sun. I am a sun worshipper so I need to have some protection. I do not burn easy and find I like the 4 the best as I get a beautiful tan without burning. When out with my friends they are always using my lotion. Also I love the smell of the lotion. Everyone says I smell like a pina colada. I usually have on hand at least two or three and have a bottle in every beach bag. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I have been buying this for over 10 years. It id silky smooth and the coconut smell is fantastic. I would recommend this product to everyone. The best lotion on the market! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I love this sunscreen so much that I use it daily for my body lotion!! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
"Works great as a sunscreen, I also love the scent and not greasy This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"In the summer we live outside! Once the deep tan has set in we still want sun protection that stays on and moisturizers. The only solution is Austrailan Gold SPF 4. The lotion keeps the darkest tan smooth and silky on the hottest days. Buy at least two for your beach days because everyone will borrow it! Best sun protection ever, based on over 45 years in the sun! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have been using this 4 after I've built up my tan using a stronger SPF, and I know I'm getting my sun protection while smelling fabulous. Even when I'm not outside, I use the lotion to smell great. And, I get complements. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I have used the 4 lotion for years, I tried 8 but it was to much block I never got a tanned. I boat 5 to 6 days a week in the sunny waters of South Florida, I prefer lotion over spray, it keeps the surrounding area cleaner with no over spray The only Drawback is the stores in my area that carries Australian gold only stock spray sunscreens The best product Australian Gold has is the Moisture Lock Tan Extender, this product stops the hurt of a bad sunburn and my skin turns into a tan the next day this product is a miracle works wonders",1
So very happy that you had what I was looking for. Love this product,1
I have been using this for years. It not only protects from the sun but leave your skin soft because it hydrates. Would never use anything else!,1
This is the best and only tanning lotion that I use. Stumbled across it several years ago while at the beaches and haven't used any other tanning lotion since. Gives you a fast and beautiful tan and it smells great! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I have used the particular lotion for years. But it is nearly impossible to find in retail stores anymore. I am very happy to be able to order it directly from the company. This lotion does not have the bronzer in it so it does not make a mess on your swimwear and towel.,1
"I have Native American blood and this lotion gives me the richest, golden, dark tan I have ever had. Plus my skin stays hydrated This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"Just discovered this product. Will use as a year round total body moisturizer. Non greasy, goes on easy and just melts into your skin. The only draw back is that it has no availability in the traditional retail distribution channels.",1
I have been using Australian gold for several years and are very happy with the results.,1
"I have been using this lotion for several years, this past year I can't find it at my local stores. I buy intone cruise ships whence cruise. I use SPF4 and reapply often. I have not burned and get allowing tan.",1
Use it every year for years now as sunscreen. Love it!,1
This lipstick stays on very well. It is very orange though.,1

"I bought this for my mom, this is her favorite color and brand, she says it goes on well and has great staying power.",1
"It is amazing how effective this is. My husband is allergic to our dog and she sleeps in our bedroom, so I kept this in our room. I could tell the difference when i had it on or off, the air was much purer with it on and if there was some kind of odor from our dog in our room the filter would get rid of it.",1
"Overall a cute tongue in cheek comedy, with some decent cinematography at points but alas, it's like they took Expendables and actually tried too hard to not make it another Expendables.. Worth a rent on the dollar list.",1

"I thought the movie was alright. I lost interest in it not even halfway through, but I did watch the whole thing. It does have action, but I prefer other movies over this one.",1
This movie was ok. Had to shut it off half way through. Red one was so much better. I was hesitant on watching the 2nd one and turns out I shouldn't have. The only thing good about the movie was that it was funny. For $7 or less watch it.,1
After seeing RED2 I wanted to see the first one because we enjoyed the second on so much. Was a little disappointed in the first one though as it is not as good as RED 2.,1
It's an alright action movie to watch once and awhile.,1
Would not buy the sequel. Just way too slow and rnding was bad.,1
Exciting and Funny. Can watch this several times. Terrific cast. Not too suspenseful.,1
Great cast! Action packed! Can't wait to see Red 2.,1
"it is good movie, but not good as red 2. I saw red 2 first, and then want see red.",1

I had seen reviews of film but hadn't seen Red and it was humorous.,1
a funny movie with very good actors but confusing plot twists,1
Another comic book turns into a movie. But much more grown up than Superman.,1

"This is a fun show. Maybe a little mindless, but who doesn't enjoy those shows now and again?",1

"RED is a fun, entertaining movie. Good action. Good comedy. Usually can't go wrong when Bruce Willis has to shoot stuff.",1
"The movie has a great story line and established actors. The love story between Willis and the girl is nice, but, weird.Great action, explosions, and acting.... What more can you want! Waiting for Red 2 this year.",1
"OK, so no academy awards here but just fun characters, great action, decent plot, excitement, etc. What else do you want? the cast sort of tells you what kind of movie this will be so without spoiling anything, if you can get it at a good price - pounce and add it to the collection.",1
movie is really good nice movie to watch with your friends,1
"For a Willis action film, RED has the most well rounded cast to balance out his humor. Although I was NOT aware that this was a film-only BD, the movie is great, and I got it for a good price.",1
Great movie with a good cast!! I can watch this over and over again. Can't wait to see the sequel.,1
Willis as willis - this old guys were spies film is a lot of fun.. much more than I expected. Look for Bones from Trek as the CIA guy. Only really negative - Mary Louise Parker - can't act - not that pretty - how did she get in this movie?,1
All star actors in an action packed feature! The comedy fits well with the movie.,1

Decent adaptation of the graphic novel enjoyable popcorn flick,1

must see good acting lots of action good ending and plot,1
"A movie to watch and enjoy the action without a lot of thought needed. You got what is expected from the main leads, Willis, Freeman, Mirren etc, lately I've seen a bit of Karl Urban in a number of action movies and he does a good job as always. Fun to watch.",1

I liked this movie when it was released. Saw it on sale and added to library. Red 2 is just as good.,1

Red has a sense of wit and whimsy as former agents are reunited against an unknown threat in their retirement.,1
Always fun to watch this film... very entertaining,1
The cast in this movie alone was enough to warrant purchasing this. The storyline was great and the dynamics between the characters was great. Cant wait to watch the sequel,1
"Good Movie, fun to watch! Great action movie to watch",1
Surprisingly good! Action packed and quick moving.,1
Retired & Extremely Dangerous(RED) a funny title I thought but it was a good movie,1
Funny dialogue. And I liked all the actors in it. Not bad for retirees.,1

I like when the older stars make movies it is always very interesting,1

Is a great action movie. My family and I enjoy very much.,0
Just a good movie all around. Funny with classic actors. Can't go wrong with this one.,1
Great movie and the price made it better. I would definitely purchase movies here again.,1
Funny movie with some old faces. Lots of fun and excitement.,1
"Action packed, w/comedic attributes & big name actors/actresses !!!",1
"RED is an action film with great performances by veteran actors, explosive action scenes, and plenty of humor. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and for those who like action but cringe at blood and gore, this is a great choice. This Blu-ray doesn't offer any special features, but for a nice home viewing experience, give RED a try.",1
The acting is good and there is a lot of action. The characters are very engaging.,1
"This was a great action movie. The only drawback to me was it sometimes got in its own way trying to add an artsy edge, especially with the transitions between scenes. Still, definitely worth watching!",1
"Love the fact Hollywood brought together these timeless actors for an action-packed, funny movie!",1
An oldie but a goody. Big guns with some laughs thrown in,1
Simply a fun story and a new take on the spy genera.,1
This is a fun movie with a great cast. Action filled with witty comments.,1
Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren are great. Loved the fast-paced action and the storyline between Bruce Willis and Mary Kay Parker.,1
It is definitely an action film and was glad that it was so cheap to buy since i've been wanting to see this for awhile.,1
I liked this movie a lot. Good to see a movie featuring some of the older actors done right. Shows that just because you're older doesn't mean you can't do a good action movie.,1
I had been looking for this since last year and I was happy to find it for only $8.00,1
Gave this as a gift. Found out after getting it that the Blue-ray edition was cheaper than DVD.,1

Entertaining movie. A humorous story that the actors interact well with each other making for an enjoyable experience allowing you to forget reality for a couple of hours.,1
REDS is a great movie. Basically old farts that r still skilled at their old CIA jobs. It was on sale on Blu-ray so I snatched it up.,1
"I wasn't too sure about this one since everyone was older and this was an action movie, but it was done with really good humor and still had plenty of action and entertainment. Surprised me in a good way, good movie!",1
This movie is so far fetched but it really cracks me up!,1
"I love the tongue in cheek, dead pan humor of this movie. I assume it is the same in the graphic novel, but I have never read it.",1
Picked this up in the Blu Ray bargain bin. Great deal on a movie I can watch over and over!,1
"This movie is an older, but good flic! Exceptional value for a Blu-ray!",1
This action-comedy has an all-star cast that works well together.,1
"This is one fun & stylish action movie. If you liked OCEAN'S ELEVEN and THE MAN FROM U.NC.L.E., you get the idea. Two actors steal the show: John Malkovich with his insanity and Helen Mirren with her machine guns. The only drawback (not from the movie) is that the disc's audio is not lossless.",1
Great vehicle to feature these great stars in a fun action packed film,1
Fun spy humor for adults. A few clever twists for your afternoon entertainment.,1
"Helen Mirren is an absolute bamf in this film. It's silly, and fun.",1

No disappointment here. Loved this movie. I've watched it several times and will no doubt watch it more.,1
WYSIWYG,0
"Can't beat ten bucks, even for a 3 year old movie. Was a new DVD. Came within the time frame Walmart gave (to the day). Movie is funny, witty dialogue, great actors and lots of great shoot em up scenes as well as some serious moments. Wanted to watch it again before going to see RED 2.",1
Works good and enjoyed the movie,1

I lve this movie and just wanted an inexpensive DVD version. This did the trick!,1

I just really like this movie. Very tongue in cheek,1
Great movie with an excellent cast of legendary actors,1

"Hilarious! I recommend it to everyone. The cast is outstanding, they work so well together.",0
"Really enjoyed the actors in this -had great characters to play! Starts a little slow, but once the first team comes to take out Bruce Willis' character -the action just go, go , goes! Loved John Malkovich, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman. The cast just really worked together well and made a great team.",0
"Just a bunch of older actors, playing the part of older spies, put out to pasture. But, these older guys find themselves being bumped off, one by one. Their retaliation is a hoot to watch! It's exciting, funny, and makes you wonder why more movies aren't this entertaining?",0
"watched five times so for, don't miss it, one of the best this year",0
"Our family loves all the stars in this movie.It did not disappoint. The film had serious parts, humor and above all plenty of action.It's nice to see movies being released that don't depend on special effects to try to entertain.",0
THIS MOVIE IS JUST GREAT. A LOT OF ACTION. FIRST HALF BETTER THAN SECOND HALF.,0
Just seen the movie RED. It is the best movie I have seen so far. I love that Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis have teamed up again for another great movie. Love the action and the post cards with the greetings from... I love John Malkovich as Marvin and the pig that he brought with him. All around great action movie.,0
"It's the perfect movie. Funny, exciting and a good plot. Yes it has a real plot, not just a bunch of special effects. Actors are great. It's a movie to rewatch every once and a while.",1
Loved the movie so much had to buy it. Great action/comedy,1
"one of the best all around light hearted action movies of all time. perfect for someone who wants actions, but not all the gore that goes with most. my mom loves this movie, in fact, this copy was for her for mothers day. need i say more. love this movie, its always on the list for when company comes over or we just want something fun & exciting to watch",1
Good action movie to add to a collection. Loved the characters,1
RED is a great movie. It's entertaining without using nudity or lots of gutter language.,1
This is one of the best films where you can get all of some great old acting talent and put it to great use!!! This movie came out perfect! It must have with a second one coming out soon and it also is highly anticipatted!!,1
This is a great movie with lots of action. Lots of big time actors.,1

"I love this movie. To me, it is one of the better Bruce Willis movies.",1
exciting kick-butt action movie.Die Hard meets Cocoon,1
"Great movie. Fast moving, always interesting. Lots of action but actually has a plot. Great seeing actors that we know in great rolls.",1
I think this movie has great potential to become a classic. It might not surpass other comic book movies but it definitely pulls its own weight.,1
Could not find this movie anywhere after seeing it on HBO. Thanks to Best Buys,1
"I haven't felt as good watching a movie since 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean. Unexpected lines and juxtapositions lift this tale. Okay, so the story is very improbable...not to worry given that part of the movie experience is suspending our disbelief.Bruce Willis charms. John Malkovich is humorously irascible. Morgan Freeman gives us his usual likable best. Helen Mirren wields an assortment of guns. And Mary-Louise Parker shows us how facial expressions and muffled sounds can turn a story line and spice up a story.There's not a single member of Willis's reunited team I wouldn't like to be around. There they are, seeking first why Bruce Willis is in the crosshairs, then why seemingly random people are getting murdered and finally bringing the evil-doers to a just end.",0
"The movie was very enjoyable, and I've recommended to others...",0
"It was worth it see Helen Miren as an assassin....need I say more? But I will, the move is a roller coaster ride form city to city, and on top of action there's cheeky humor.",0
I suspect these great actors had as much fun making this film as I had watching it. Not a classic in the traditional sense; but this will be watched more because it is such fun.Don't think Blu-Ray is needed for this type of film except for media connoisseurs. A digital copy would be great. I can't think of many movies I would rather watch on a long layover or on a long trip.,1
"The only way to make this movie better is to buy it on Blu Ray! Great writing, no slow or dull spots, beautifully filmed action sequences, and the cast are just great together.",0
Good movie with humor and action to keep me entertained throughout,1
A fun over-the-top movie with lots of action and laughs,1
"haven't seen it, but heard that its an amazing action movie. giving as a present.",1
"I really enjoyed this action movie. Has a lot of older, fantastic actors in it.",1
"I loved watching this movie. plenty of twist and turns, to keep you watching the out come. all the actors did well. I'm glad they made a part 2 for the movie. I hope they continue making more parts for this movie.",1
"I love all Bruce WIllis movies, this one is no exception. Him and Morgan Freeman were great together. Looking forward to RED 2. You will enjoy this movie.",1
Bruce Willis and John Malkovich are great in this movie. It is full of action but has great one liners through out the film.,1
Loved the movie. My husbands favorite series of movies.,1
"One of the better spy movies out there. I bought it because my wife wanted to see Red 2, and I felt it would be better to see the first movie first. It's one of the few movies I own that I've watched more than twice.",1
"excellent movie with alot of action . the plot is believable, where the actors make you laugh out loud.",1
"Fantastic Spy film about the CIA trying unsuccessfully to ""retire"" some of their retired operatives... Great action and humor by entire cast!",1
I orderd on line and picked it up at the CS Desk at BB great system. they were friendly at the Morrow Ga BB store,1

I really enjoyed watching this film. I was fast paced and never lack for action. Kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the show. Get it yourself and see. Very funny as well.,1

Good cast and very funny action film.Worth watching again,1
"It is a creative spin on secret agent work. The actors played their parts perfectly, especially John Malkovich.",1
Great movie that is funny and action packed. the second red movie is just as good too.,1
"Great variety of actors!, great action!, humorous!",1
"The cast made this one of the most fun movies I've seen. You come to expect action from Bruce Willis, but Helen Mirren was soooo good",1
I wasn't expecting too much from this film but I was pleasantly surprised by this great little movie.The amazing cast helps drives this film along and the idea of an aging team of assassins lends itself to some great comedy moments that sit nicely alongside the action scenes.,1
"funny movie, my daughter who loves pigs loves the part with ""open the pig""",1
"Good movie, very funny most of the time, I like all the actors in this movie.",1
"A great movie, very funny with lot's of action. 'the way the relationship between the main characters is funny and makes you want to root for them to be together.",1

The Movie was great with the action and shooting people.,1
I loved this movie. Everyone is wonderful in his (or her) part. Can't wait to see RED 2.,1
"good movie, plenty of action and intrigue, interesting plot twists",1
I liked the movie but the first was a lot better. I was not expecting a lot because it was a sequel. It is worth a watch.,1
"I like the idea that getting old doesnt mean you gotta slow down, just another chapter in life",1
"Great movie, Bruce Willis does fantastic as always. Karl Urban was a surprise hit for me in this movie doing a fantastic job. Much better than red 2.",1
RED is a great movie with an All-Star cast. All the actors portray their characters flawlessly and make this an easy watch for anyone wanting to have a good time watching a movie.,1
This is a very good movie. It does stray a little but is a joy to watch. I just don't like that there are no deleted scenes or outtakes on this disk. The DVD version at least has one deleted scene on it. But was worth buying.,1
Bruce Willis fan and always like his movies. Lots of Action.,1
the characters provided an explosive return to be the best,1
Lots of action and full of humor. It was very entertaining.,1
Great movie. Great plot. Great price. It's a great movie to own.,1

On of my favorite Bruce willis movies. I enjoyed all the action and well placed jokes,1
Had seen this and wanted a copy of my own. Good comedy that really pokes fun at the various spy networks and countries.,1

I loved this movie since I first saw it and have been looking for it for a long time at a great price and I did!,1
"This is a great movie, hope the sequel lives up to this.",1

"Great cast, good story and after watching the movie, had to purchase Red2 to see what happened next!",1
"I love a great comedy, the cast of this movie was all top notch actors and really worked great together",1
We love this movie! The plot is good with a lot of twists and turns that are often delivered in humorous ways. Yet the humor only adds to the plot and doesn't detract from the basic story line as with lots of comedy. The humor is understated and not slapstick or overdone as with some comedies. This is a great show!,1
"I loved the movie, I thought 2 was even better than 1 not sure if they will make another one, but I hope so.",1
Good movie in general. Shows off the capabilities of a home theater system!,1
This movie was a great one to add to my collection! The combination of Willis and Malkovitch is hysterical. The action was just perfect and the story line was cute. And was even better after they made the sequel!,1
"Great story with comedy, action, good story, great actors, and even a touch of romance...kinda. Bruce is great, but everyone seems to be having so much fun that everyone is stealing the show from him. It makes for some great ensemble and a movie to watch and rewatch.",1
It's good action/comedy about retired spies or agents getting back into working to help a fellow spy who's also retired. They have elite skills and give active agents a run for there money...It has a lot of funny scenes... It's a movie that could be watched over and over.,1
"This is a very funny movie with great actors. There is a lot of action, some of it funny and over the top.",1
It is very good DVD. I think Sound and resolution is good.,1
Great dc comic conver to movie. if you like Bruce Willis you will like this. John Malkovich is great.,1
I saw Red 2 first and had to get this movie just because the second is awesome. Red 1 lives up to my expectations and more!,1
Red is a great movie. Hilarious plot and love all the actors.,1
"Fun Movie with great action, plot and wonderful cast. The pace was great and the special effects were pretty spectacular.",1
I enjoyed watching it and have seen it already twice.I enjoyed watching Bruce Willis.,1
A great sequel if you enjoyed the first installment. Entertaining action and story.,1
Great movie! I would recommend this movie to everyone.,1
I LOVE this movie!! The cast is fantastic and the chemistry between them is wonderful. We laughed (and almost cried) through the movie. This movie is worth seeing over and over again! All of the cast give 100%!!!,1
Special features makes this worth the price ($5). Check out the deleted scenes.,1
One of those surprisingly unexpected awesome action/comedy movies that I thought was going to be boring because of the over powered cast. It turns out to be funny with some good action.,1
This movie caught me by surprise when I saw it on cable.I had no idea what it was all about when I watched it (nothing else was on) and I got sucked in! Who says ya gotta be a washed up-has been just because your age has moved north of fifty?!?? Young people take a hint.It's called EXPERIENCE BABY (and LOTS OF IT in the case of this cast!),1

The movie is a refreshing change from the intense Shooting and Chasing in action flicks. The added humor in this movie is really refreshing!! The only thing better is RED2!!,1
"Saw this at the theater when it released, had to own it...now own it and its nearly equal sequel: RED 2.

"I rented the sequel and laughed so hard watching it. I just had to go buy the first installment to see how it all began. John Malkovich's character is by far my favorite. ""I'm getting the pig!""",1

Helen is tremendous. John M is creative and crazy. So much fun, and then there's the equally great sequel. Get them both.",1

Great Movie to add to our collection. Great customer Service!,1
"Opening Scene: The mundane daily routine of a retired CIA Covert Operative is exposed  it was routine. The show is most likely one of the best spy  counter spy flicks that I have seen. With a superb blend of senior casting, sensitive directorship, and a very well-written plot-line of pure table-pounding action/intrigue entertainment this is the type of film you will visit again, and there is a twist around every corner that is guaranteed to keep your interest up! It is interesting that the plots star character, Frank [Francis], is a pure romantic with a hard exterior but is soft and gooey on the inside.",1
"This movie is great. You have fighting, people blowing up stuff, and humor. My kind of film",1
Red and Red2 are awesome! I loved seeing these actors. It was great to see actors as they age. They still have so much to offer in good movies!,1

great movie very action packed and just exciting in general,1
I watched Red 2 before the first one. Red is a great movie with action and humor.,1

"Lots of fun and action. Sometimes, I got the impression that the entire script was played tongue-in-cheek, but it's more than that.",1
An all star cast that will make you laugh and leaving you wanting to see it again.,1
Some movies you watch once and then never again. This movie you can watch over and over and always see something new to laugh at.,1
"Action pack movie. Has some funny parts to the movie, but really enjoyed it. Old friends coming together after a long time. Must watch!",1

Whoever did the casting for this movie should get an award. An unlikely crew with an unlikely story add up to some great laughs and lots of action. Malkovich's character is hilarious!,1
Had to by this movie Bruce willis is one of my favorite actors,1
Picked it up for $4.99 sale to add to my collection. Have always loved this movie.,1

"I got this movie in the clearance bin, and really enjoy it.",1
My Mom raved about this movie. I wouldn't have seen it if she hadn't recommended it.Fun!,1
Great movie that we have loved for years. Bought the movie to add to our blue ray collection. Would recommend it for everyone,1
"Enjoyable, my wife loves watching this movie. Fun, some violence, language not over done in swearing. We watch it again and again.",1
It is rare to find a movie that is packed with so many stars of the screen and is not a movie in which the stars carry a flimsy or non existent story line (script). This movie Red has a solid script and story line and so many stars of the screen that I had to take my shoes off and use my toes to count all of them. I found it amazing that none of the stars stole the screen over the others and the camera loved watching them work together a team to provide a very rich experience that sucked me into the movie.,1
Awesome movie. Lots of great action and funny scenes.,1
Love the Red movies. They are exciting and fun. It was on sale and cheaper to buy than rent.,1
Great Movie!!!! But it! Very funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1

Bought the first one and love it. The second one is even better.,1
found movie in clearances bin . very happy I bought it,1
I admit when I first watched this movie I didn't expect much. I think I went to see it at a dollar theater to pass some time but it turned out to be a really fun trip. I found this in the bargain bin at Best Buy during Christmas and decided to get it for a family member since I figured they (like me) would not have sought it out on their own.,1
Best action/comedy I've seen for a while. Excellent price,1
"Great Characters, Movie, Plot. It has it all. In fact I would recommend Red 2.Entertaining and Enjoyable. All you could want for a Movie Night.",1
I really enjoyed this movie which is why I bought this copy on blu-ray. The price was very affordable.,1
I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time. I saw it on sale and realized I had some free time. I had a Red/Red2 marathon. They are now two of my favorite films!,1
"This is a funny yet still a awesome movie with plenty of action, cant wait to watch the 2nd one.",1
it jas alot of adventure and great movie and would recommend to friends,1
One of the best movies geared toward the older audiences! Even my kids love it!,1
"My wife loves this movie so we had to buy it, not many movies that I enjoy that she likes to watch",1
Cool movie with a fun story attached. Great movie for bringing in the truly great actors,1
Just adding to the collection. Was on sale for $3.00,1
This movie is funny and exciting and full of action. I love that the actors are older spies. They work so well with each other so that you believe that they have known each other for a long time. This adds to the story and pulls you in.,1
Great movie i would reccomend it to a friend. Best buy always has a great selection of movies.,1
Love it! Everyone should watch this! It is really good.,1
"As the first of 2 so far, this is excellent. Great action. Keeps you wondering how it's going to end. Enjoyed it a lot.",1
Great balance of humor and action. Many talented stars.,1
John Malkovich is at his weirdest best in this action packed thriller.,1
Good movie with a good cast and plenty of twists in the plot.,1
This is just a funny movie. How can anyone not recommended this,1
This is a really great movie. It is very enjoyable. The 2nd one is not as good.,1
What's not to love with a cast like this and all that action,1
The movie was good and customer service was excellent.,1
All the elements of an action film along with biting humor and sarcasm.,1
"If you retire well and stay in the swing of things, you, too can... well, if you were a 007 level operative, you can keep a semblance of your youth. AT least for this team....",1
This is a great action move but like the storyline as well.,1
"This movie was very funny and shows the lighter side of some great actors/actresses. Though some may view the plot as dubious, that is not the reason for watching this film. Watch these great folks deliver some really funny stuff.",1
This movie is a great comedy with a brilliant cast of characters. It is great to see an action film made into a comedy.,1
A very excellent and entertaining movie. It is pure entertainment.,1
I loved all the actors in this humor tinged thrill ride,1
I enjoy this action pack movie. I also love the humor!! You can watch this movie many times.,1
Great movie. Great story. Great cast. Funny and action packed.,1
I've never seen it till we got it. Its not bad at all,1
I was looking for this terrific movie at a discount and Best Buy came through AGAIN!!! I watch it whenever I need a laugh.,1
The actors flow so well together. I have watched part one and two and they are both entertaining,1
"If you liked the movie on a regular DVD, it's even better on Blu-ray. All of the action is right in your face.",1
"The characters are all familiar and in some cases play an unexpected roll. The end is not surprising but the path taken keeps you on your toes and completely involved. Bruce Willis is predictable and his ""older friends"" are all playing their characters extremely well. I would recommend this for people from teens to old age. Actually purchased a second copy for a friend.",1
"I had never heard of these movies and decided to give it a try. Well, this is a definite must see! The cast is fantastic! There is so much action you will never be bored! Make sure you see all of them....",1
"This movie is really action packed, I'm so looking forward to the sequel!",1

"We borrowed this DVD from the library, and when I saw it at such a great price I got it to enjoy many more times. It has a lot of action and humor.",1

"I really like this movie but the online price is 2.50 more than in the store, I only payed 5.00 for this movie at the store. Best movie I've seen In almost 3 years.",1
This is a very good movie. I highly recommend it. It has a lot of heart warming action without the gore and graffic love scenes. Very little language. A lot of fun.,1
"This movie has a lot of big name older stars, that still have the moves. It is a great twist on the Spy game. Great action sequnces, lots of humor, great acting.",1
This is a movie my husband and I enjoyed at the theaters. My adult children watched it with us here at home for a movie night and agreed it was a good choice.,1
This is a fast paced action comedy with an excellent ensemble cast. Bruce willis and crew aim to please and don't fail from start to finish,1
Great!,1
I have been able to find and purchase several movies that I have been looking for for a long time thank you very much,1
I saw that Red 2 was coming out at the movies and never saw the first one. Had to get it before I saw the second one.,1

great movie! great price!,1
Bought on sale great price. Fun to watch.,1
"Excellent movie, see second movie.",1
"Opening Scene: The mundane daily routine of a retired CIA Covert Operative is exposed ��� it was routine. The show is most likely one of the best spy ��� counter spy flicks that I have seen. With a superb blend of ���senior��� casting, sensitive directorship, and a very well-written plot-line of pure table-pounding action/intrigue entertainment this is the type of film you will visit again, and there is a twist around every corner that is guaranteed to keep your interest up! It is interesting that the plots star character, Frank [Francis], is a pure romantic with a hard exterior but is soft and gooey on the inside.",1
Fan of Bruce Willis movies���a friend recommended this one to watch! Plenty of action and comedy���worth watching over again!,1
"Red is great popcorn fun that I think you will enjoy. The movie stars Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Mary-Louise Parker, Karl Urban, and very funny John Malkovich. The movie is directed by Robert Schwentke, who previously directed The Time Traveler's Wife and Flightplan. The plot of the movie Frank (Bruce Willis is retired, bored and lonely living off his government pension in a nondescript suburb in an equally nondescript house. The only joy in Frank's life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah Mary-Louis Parker). Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces Frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into Franks past and the people he used to work with. Like Frank they are all RED ... Retired Extremely Dangerous. I enjoyed this movie and I think you will too. Thank you for reading my review",0
This movie was absolutely great. i usually not big into action but my dad is and we both loved it so much that i bought it for us right after we rented it,0
Good movie and Bruce Willis was a success again!,0
A FUN MOVIE IT WILL HOLD YOUR INTREST,0

My husband and I just love this movie.,0

"Good movie, funny, very good actors,",0
Does not disappoint,0
Price was great.,0
"inconvenient to go to the back of the store to photo department instead of customer service, won't do it again",0
I love this movie! It is funny very action packed and the actors/actresses are great! Well put together! A lot of awesomeness in this one movie! I watch it all the time just because it's that good! Love love love!!,1
This is a great movie! I love this movie and when you buy from Walmart- it is also available on VUDU!,1
"I could drink this with a straw. Nasty, full of water. What happened to your good chili",1
"I was completely disappointed in this item. I opened the can and there was a smell emanating from it that made me sick. Since it was just 2.00, I threw it away. I will NEVER purchase this chili again. I know it may have been a bad can, but that smell was like dead flesh. UGH!",0
I can not eat anything with Monosodium glutamate in it. I would love to eat your chili but until it is MSG free I can not,1
I used to buy Hormel chili all the time because it did not have pork in it. Now I will not be buying it. I was very surprised to see this. Why did you have to add pork,1
Bland and want buy again,1
"This recipe for your chill is horrible. You need to revert back to the recipe you used twenty years ago, then it taste great. I will not be buying your chill until a new and improved recipe comes out. And it better be good.",1
I had to throw out all my Hormel Chili. Some of us don't eat pork for reasons other than health and this was always in our food stock. Very sad that they changed and DID NOT TELL ANYONE! Now we know.,1
"Purchased this chili for years. It was the best. Would buy by the case and eat once or twice a week. About a year or so ago Something changed. Now I have a lot of cans that I will not eat and really would not even give away, it's that bad. It sits on the shell and finally I have resolved to just toss it out.",1
"Same as Wolf brand that is why we quit Wolf brand and now they are the same. Watery, no meat and yuk!!!! We will never buy again. We will just make our own",1
"I have been buying Hormel chili all my life, the can I opened tonight was the worst. It made the whole hotdog taste bad. It was runny, no meat, so runny it made the bun soggy! I hope Hormel fixes this problem. I'd hate to change brands.",1
"Use to be years ago this is the only kind of chili my grandparents had in our house, but I will not be buying it anymore since I now know that it has pork in it. I do not eat pork, so surely do not want it in my chili",1
I usually buy the turkey no bean chili so had not had this for years. Well I accidently grab this product and I could not believe how runny and lack of meat was in this chili. It had the consistency of soup which was pretty pitiful since I was having chili dogs. Very sad,1
"Hormel added pork to their no beans chili, since I cannot eat pork I can no longer enjoy my previously favored brand. On top of it there were no warning on the label indicating that they had a major recipe change and I can no longer trust this brand. I would love to be able to eat their product, previously it had been my go-to and always in my pantry.",1
Used to buy this often. Either the chili has changed or my taste buds have! Would not buy again,0
Runny,1
"This tastes like canned hot dog sauce more than chili. It might be okay on a hot dog with onions, but not for a bowl of chili. I won't buy it again.",1
Did not care for the taste and too greasy.,0
"I LIKE HORMEL CHILI, BUT, WALMART HAS PROBLEMS WITH CANNED GOODS. BUY IT AT THE STORE. BIG TIME DENTS.",1
"Good product, way too expensive.",0
the recipe in the cans has changed over the years. I enjoyed the older versions. They had a better chili favor. The last few years I had to add more chili powder.,1
"Since when does Hormel put pork in their hormel chili :( i cant eat pork, so now I can't enjoy my hormel chili cheese dip :(",1
"The chili is great on a hotdog, but it doesn't taste real good alone.",1
I like it,1
Great for chilly dogs,1
Ok for chili in a can,1
The chilie was good on the hot dogs and cheese. I really like the one with bean's.,0
Works in a pinch with hotdogs,0
Good on chili dogs!,0
It's ok,1
Great for Texas hots. The only one I've found that has real meat in it.,1
Love this stuff but you gotta have BEANS!,1
We have used Hormel Chili No Beans for a very long time. We use it on our hot dogs.,1
Good price and product,1
We love this at our house. We use it as one ingredient to make a quick mexican dip to snack on or for parties. Add over a block of cream cheese and top with your favorite cheese and jalepenos as you like.....bake or microwave and serve!,0
"Hormel chili is a great chili for those looking for a meatier home made chili taste. It's thicker that Texas Pete's and avoids the blandness of Patterson's. This chili is close to Mama's so when you're looking for a chili deserving of a hot dog, look no further than Hormel.",0
Love hot chili with cheese.,1
Been using about 25 years. Good for so many dishes.,1
"I love to use this to make chili dogs and chili cheese fries. I tried other fancier brands, but I always go back to this.",1
"Meal in a can, very good, I will buy more",1
"I use this to make a dip. Mix 8 oz cream cheese with chili, heat and serve with tortilla chips.",1
"Item has a reasonable price. If a lot of item is age, note that it causes severe acne.",1
I haven't used this yet but have had Hormel products before and been happy.,1
"I bought this thinking that no beans meant low carbs but I was wrong - 19g carbs per serving (2 per can). Good flavor, slight chili buzz. The texture is a bit pasty but is great for putting on hot dogs or in tacos.",1
We use this on hot dogs with shredded cheese! Yummy!,1
"I look for brands I like . but can't always get them as quantities are too large. This isn't as spiced as I like, but Wolfe Brand is all sauce and little meat now.",0
always liked this chili,0
This is great if you add it to Velveta or cheese sauce.,0
"I use this chili on my beef enchlidas, so good.",1
Cant really mess up canned chili cheese tatter tots,1
Exactly what I was expecting,1
Love this chili. Great as chili and also as dip mixed with Velveeta cheese or cream cheese. Dip with crackers or corn chips. Great for the holidays.,0
Easy and always GOOD.,1
I love this chili on hot dogs...or a chili dog!,0
Always good on hotdogs but better in dip,0
Always use this to make haystacks,0
This is usually a good product!,0
Plenty of flavor and was a great topping for the hotdogs!,1
I use this Hormel Chili - No Beans for chili and cheese tater tots. My daughter is not a bean fan so this works great!,1
used for chili dogs,1
...,1
I have tried a majority of your chilli products awesome,1
"I always buy this product because I do not like chili with beans. As I have aged, beans don't like me! But I've never been able to understand why it cost more to remove beans from a can of chili than to add beans!",1
Good quality and taste,1
I used it in my dip and it was delicious .... I use the bean kind too both are amazing!!,1
"Tastes good, but it is canned chili, so don't expect gourmet. I use it on hotdogs, as well as dips for chips. But to eat it like a bowl of chili, no way.",1
Great on hot dogs!,1
Works great for chili dogs,1
Always buy this brand,1
Good item. Use it to make chili dogs!,1

"I love using this chili with rice and butter in a casserole. The flavors are amazing, and my kids love it!",1
Taste and texture are perfect for a chili dog,0
"I add a can of this plus one can of stewed or other flavor tomatoes plus one can of red kidney beans and a pound of cooked, drained ground beef. my family members have always thought I had a secret chili recipe happening. it freezes in servings for the chili dogs at midnite with a topping of cheese. for years it has worked for me!",0
"I always use the Hormel Chili Hot No Beans for my chili dip. A very simple recipe and everyone loves it! Mix 2 cans of the 15oz chili with 1 lb shredded jalapeno jack cheese. I cook it in a slow cooker/crock pot, stirring occasionally until the cheese is melted. Serve with tortilla chips (scoops work best). Hope you enjoy them!",0
Good tasting a GREAT value!,0
Apparently the Wal mart store I frequent never has Hormel Turkey Chili wth no beans which I prefer. So I buy Hormel Chili no beans instead. It's been several months since I've seen it on the shelf. And who ever orders replenishment for the store must not like it cause I never see it. Along with frozen vegetables like Coliflower I've asked several times over the last year for those two items and I get a we'll try harder next time. The shelf label is there just not the correct product. Everything I buy at WalMart is good and fresh when available especially the produce like fresh Coliflower which I cut up an freeze before using as needed. I like shopping at WalMart and usually find everything I need when I don't I improvise or substitute.,0
"Lol. Never been asked to review a canned good. It's a can of chili, people! The cylinder shape of the package was phenomenal. Loved the sound of popping the top. It's a consistent, reliable product. My son loves with Fritos. Rofl.",1
This is the only chili product I consume. I would never buy another brand. It tastes great and doesn't have odd additives I don't like.,0

It actually HAS some beans in it though!,1
Great chili every time.,1
Great for making chili dogs,1
"Yes, I did buy this item and this is the only one I do buy when I need canned chili to serve with hotdogs. It's a brand I can count on. I would like to buy the one with beans but I have to please everyone in the family, so I just buy the plain, no beans. I would recommend these to everyone.",0
We really like hot dogs and every once in a while we make some great chilli dogs with Hormel Chili its fast and ready for the boys quick and they love it. add some cheese and onions and wala they are happy campers,0
"An quick alternative to making chili from scratch. Good on a dog, or on it's own and can easily be doctored up to put some heat in it.",0
"I loe Hormel chili! Great taste alone, on a hot dog or baked potato or on chips. I also use this product or Hormel Chili with Beans in my homemade chili for a little extra burst of flavor.",0
"My man grew up with this and he loves it for chili. I use it for a sauce on a hot dog. Either way, it's good to eat.",0
I wouldn't buy any other but Hormel.I think it has best taste than any of the others.My number 1 pick always.,0
"My husband will only eat Hormel chili without beans. He loves on hotdogs, spaghetti, and by itself. We recently started eating it on super nachos. It's great!",0

The only product I use on my hotdogs.,1
This is the best hot dog chili.,1
"For years we've been making Ugly Dip (cuz it's just not that pretty to look at!) with a can of Hormel Chili NO Beans and one brick of cream cheese. Microwave for about a minute, stir, and continue until all the cheese is blended. Fabulous with corn/tortilla chips and people rave about it - thinking it was much more difficult to make than it really is!! It never lasts long...",1
"I buy this chili regularly and my daughter loves it when when I heat it up in a large bowl, cover it with shredded cheddar cheese and heat it again to melt the cheese. Then she uses Tostitos scoops to scoop and eat it. She is older and out of the house now but when she comes home she always looks forward to her chili bowl!",1

My favorite store bought chili! Good price.,1
Great for chili dogs all summer.,1
My favorite for hotdogs and without the beans has a great chili flavor. Seems to be very lean and not full of fat and grizzle. I pay a little more for quality when it comes to this.,1
This is the only kind of chili I buy to put on hot dogs. It has a great flavor and texture.,1
It's the BEST,1
Very Good!,1
not too watery and good with hot dogs,1

I use this for chili cheese dip. Very good,1
Its a delicious food. I like it. I would recommend it.,1
"I love this chili, it's the only kind out of a can I'll eat! My only suggestion is considering making cans half of the size of this one because I always end up throwing half of it away :(",1
Very convenient,1
"I have tried other no bean brands of chili and they almost always have beens. This is the only one I have found that actually has NO BEANS, and it tastes great too (which is the important part right)",1
Its delicious on a hotdog,1
"Hormel Chili with no beans has been my families favorite for years! I remember my mother using it to make me chili dogs and now I use it for my kids and I'm happy to say they love it! I have tried other brands but we can always taste the difference, even the kids will notice the lack of meat and flavor in the other brands. Hormel always wins in my house!",1

Only canned chili I will buy. Great flavor and less fat than some other brands.,1

This is the best chili around! I wish I could find it in Australia,1
"Hotdogs and chili is a weakness for me, I just don't feel right when I go without for too long. And it's always hormel no beans when I do. I've recently started chopping up the hot dogs and making my own sort-of burrito, it's very tasty, I don't know why I never thought of it before.",1
Has good flavor for chli dogs and frito pie.,0
This is a great product. I use it in making Tamale Pie. Love it!,0
Nothing to say here.,0
This meal was extremely sweet and had a very strong pepper flavor. I could not eat it.,0
"Chicken was white meat, breaded, about 3 pieces, lots of bell pepper, Sauce was thick on the rice and contents and totally overwhelmed it. Did not care for the taste of the sauce.",0
This had really bad flavor. Was not a good product.,0
"Chicken quality was poor. Taste was not good, overall not worth the money.",0
Loaded with salt and carbs.. Grammy,1
"For my personal preference I won't buy this again, the rice was sticking together and only a few morsels of chicken.",1
"It had good taste quality. However, near the bottom the rice was gummy and it wasn't mixed proportionately.",1

"This is an outstanding product, it not only cleans surfaces, but it has such a clean and fresh smell..I use it all the time.",1
"I have been an avid user of Clorox Wipes for many years and loved them. Something has been changed about them recently and my last 3 purchases have all exhibited this change - the SMELL. It is awful. They all smell the same. I don't know if people on the west coast are familiar with stink bugs but here on the east coast, there is an infestation. That's exactly how the Clorox wipes smell now. Please change back to the old formula QUICK!!!!!!",1
"I have used Clorox Wipes for years... Cannot live without them (or prefer not to). Now the smell is so irritating, I will have to purchase another brand to continue my Spring cleaning. I've never had such a strong objection to the smell of any cleaning product. Please at least offer a choice in the old vs. new formula.",1
"I use Clorox wipes fanatically all over my home and I have done so for years - I have always loved them...until now! I just got the wipes with grease fighting power and it smells HORRIBLE. The main reason I use these wipes is because they make stuff smell fresh and clean. I am sad to say, I may be looking for a new product. Maybe Clorox can offer 2 different kinds I don't really have grease in my bathroom, or on my main kitchen counter spaces, usually grease is only on my stove...",1
"Being a mom of three, disinfecting the home has always been a big priority to keep my family healthy and germs at a minimum. I always turn to Clorox to make that happen. I have been using these products for many years and will continue to do so. Thanks for all of the great products that you offer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"LOVE Clorox wipes, but this batch is horrible. The wipes have separated and won't come out of canister in one piece. They rip and tear apart which then makes using 1 wipe useless. You have to get several out just to clean something. The smell is great tho.",1
"I normally buy Clorox brand disinfecting wipes over generic wipes because I like the Fresh Scent. I notice that you've changed the scent and strongly dislike it. While I'll look for Lavender scent in the future, I suspect it does not have wide distribution.",1
Please go back to original scent/formula!! The other scent was wonderful...New one literally gives me a headache!! So sad.,1
"I would give ZERO stars to the New Formula Clorox Wipes. I agree with all the other users that say the new formula smells awful. It may cut grease now but I liked the old streak free formula a lot better and it smelled nice. Whatever is in the new formula that cuts grease also makes my hands burn. I've switched to my store brand now since they work just as well as the new formula and they smell better. And they don't make my hands burn when I use them! And they don't leave streaks all over my bathroom counters, mirrors and stove like the Clorox wipes do now. Everyone (including me) used to love Clorox wipes when they first came out. Learn a lesson Clorox- if it isn't broke, don't try to fix it!",1
These are the most frustrating and useless wipes on the market. They rip coming out of the container! If I can't get them out of the container in one piece what good is a bunch of little pieces. Not happy at all! This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
I have used Clorox wipes for a number of years and was excited to try the new products. While I really like the new dispensing top the new scent is unpleasant and I wouldn't call it lemon. I also didn't think that the quality of cleaning was as good as the old product. While the new wipe is textured on one side and soft on the other I felt like I had to scrub much harder and the surface didn't get as clean. I will not buy this product again.,1
"I was expecting these wipes to have a strong clorox smell but they don't, they actually have a refreshing fragrance. I use them regularly and feel confident that I'm eliminating germs from every surface on which I use them.",1
I LOVE clorox wipes and have used them and recommended them to all my friends since they came out. That being said the change in formula that adjusted the fragrance is horrible. They give me migraines every time they are used in the house and leave a horrible chemical scent instead of the old fresh clean smell. Please go back to the old one because I love your brand and will hate to switch.,1

It's a waste of sheets, very time consuming to stop and deal with straightening out the knot/jam in the tear point on the container. When separating by hand it appears the perforations were light or non-existent.",1
"I really like the effecitiveness of the clorox wipes, but they all (no matter what scent you use) leave the WORST lint all over whatever you're using them on. It's even on my hands after I've thrown the used wipe away. I will continue to use them, simply because nobody else makes as effective of a wipe, but I will also to continue to be annoyed every time I use them because I have to go back with a cloth to remove the lint the wipes have left behind.",1

Clorox wipes are easy to use around the house instead of using paper towels. I have a laminate floor so I use them a lot for dirt and spills but I soon noticed the floor was sticky after. I tried cleaning my windows with them but they leave residue marks. I love the smell of all the wipes. I saw someone else commented on the lint residue they leave after cleaning and I also have this problem. They are good for a quick clean but other than that they are average.,1

I love using this product at home and in my classroom. It is easy to grab out of the cabinet and disinfect an area. I am a little uncomfortable letting the kids at school use them because it is a harsh cleaning agent (at least in my mind). But I use them frequently once the kids have gone home. The only thing I find frustrating is they don't seem to pick up dust. They mostly just smear when it comes to dust.,1
"I use Clorox on everything in the house really. Not only does it disinfect but it smells so good. The only problem i had was they are so thin,i have to use more than one, and once opened i have a hard time keeping them wet, .

They do a superb job cleaning (we especially use them in the kitchen and bathroom) and disinfecting, and the scent's pleasant too -- not too overpowering, but just enough so it doesn't smell like traditional cleaner. The individual sheets aren't so big they're hard to work with, but not so small you can't get a decent surface area done, either. My only quibble would be that the containers don't keep the wipes from drying out as well as I'd like. They can occasionally be hard to close, and hard to get the sheets to stay in the part where you pull them out. Not that these dry out quickly, but that a more robust container might preserve these even longer. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"In 2009 I bought a brand new car with a brand new baby to put in it. As the baby has grown into a messy boy, the car has grown filthy. I attempted to clean the muck off with car cleaners and just couldn't ever get all the yuck off... and they always smelled bad. My husband suggested Clorox with the added, it couldn't hurt to try it. Hesitant about the results and the abrasiveness on my car, I started to scrub. I'll be honest and tell you I went through a whole container, but the car has never looked better! And I didn't mind going through a whole container because Clorox was so much more affordable than the stinky car cleaners. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"I really like using wipes to clean counter tops or other surfaces instead of using a cleaner and a paper towel or rag because of the convienience. I really like the smell and feel the area is clean but for really getting a stain or scrubbing, i have found other products that have scubby side of the wipes, also i havnet found that stains from blue berries or things that you need to use other cleaners for that these work on. overall they are great because they disinfecr, smell good and clean!

"I love the convenience of these wipes. They are sturdy yet soft and stay moist when sealed properly, and they are able to clean and disinfect in tight spaces. Whenever my family gets sick I go around the house wiping surfaces that are often touched, including remotes and door/faucet handles. I used to do this with lysol spray but found it much more convenient to just target the areas I need without accidentally spraying all over the place (including on my pets!). The Fresh aroma is pretty average and I plan on trying the other scents in the future.",1
"I love this product and use it daily. The price is reasonable and it always leaves my kitchen smelling fresh, not only that, but I know it is disinfecting my counters from certain bacteria. I would recommend this product to almost anyone. When I say almost anyone it is because on the label it says that you have to wipe down the surface with water if you plan to put food on it later, which I worry about with my 13 month old daughter. So read the label. But other than that I love it :)",1
"The Clorox disinfecting wipes (lemon scent) are a great product. I use them all the time in my kitchen because they disinfect and they also get out a lot of stuck on food. I also use them in various places around the house as they are so easy to use. Just grab one and go! You can also buy the smaller packs and use them to disinfect public areas where you might catch the flu. A few examples are shopping cart handles, tables at restaurants, and even door handles in public restrooms. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1
"These wipes are great for quick and easy clean up of messes. I use them to clean just about every surface of my house. The smell is pleasant and they don't leave behind a harsh bleachy smell.

"As a mother of 5, I use disinfectant wipes often. These are handy to wipe down the stair railings, remotes, phones and keep some in the car to wipe off the steering wheel and door. As with just about every pop up wipe container though, I wish there was a better way to make them come out easier at the beginning and the end. Its always a struggle to get them started and at the end they all come out out at once and they are dripping wet. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1

These wipes were great for keeping the messes contained and dis-infecting the kitchen floor as needed.",1

"I love Clorox disinfecting wipes. They are so convenient to use and they give me piece of mind knowing that whatever gets wiped with them really is, well, clean! I use them on my counters after cutting meat poultry, in my bathroom on my toilet and sink, and they are great for things you touch everyday but never bother to clean, like the trash can lid, door handles, and light switches. I always have a canister within easy reach in my kitchen and bathroom. Oh, and I never travel without my Clorox wipes! I always take some wipes from the canister, stick them in a Ziploc bag, and put them in my purse. Ever been disgusted my a public restroom or porta-potty Not anymore! One time, while at a Kings of Leon concert, my friends and I were waiting in the long line for the ladies room when I suggested to just use the porta-pottys in the smoking area. They were all like, Eww! Gross! No way am I going in one of those! So, I grabbed my Ziploc full of wipes, hopped right into a porta-potty no line, score!, wiped down the door handle first then the seat, gave it a minute to dry and BAM, I'm good to go. Not only did I get back before my friends had even gotten a stall, but I got to use a CLEAN toilet where as they had to do the squat and shuffle! Needless to say, they opted to use the porta-potty the next time around and they stopped making fun of me for being a clean freak....who's laughing now!!! The only reason I didn't give these wipes 5 stars is because they leave streaks and don't work awesomely word or not, I used it! lol on greasy messes...I still have to take out my degreaser when I clean my kitchen.

I love the Clorox wipes! I love to keep them handy for a quick clean up. These were perfcect when we went camping to clean up the camper and tables.

The Clorox wipes are much better to use than generic or even other name brand cleaning wipes. They smell great and I know that it keeps our bathrooms clean since they also include bleach.

"For years, I've kept Clorox wipes in my kitchen and bathroom at home, but I recently started keeping a canister in my desk at work. They're great for quickly disinfecting the phone, keyboard, door knobs....even pens. Once I realized how infrequently the cleaning staff cleans our desks, and how often I eat lunch at my desk, I realized I needed to take matters into my own hands. I now give everything a quick wipe down at least once a day.....even more often during cold and flu season. I really like the lemon scented wipes for this task- they smell clean without smelling too much like a cleaning product. I highly recommend grabbing a few canisters to keep at work, in the car, and of course in the kitchen and bath as well. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",1

I always trust clorox wipes and here is why. When my son was a baby he got a very bad stomach virus to the point of almost being hospitalized for dehydration. I began to wipe is crib and everything that came in contact with down every couple of hours for the next 24 hr. What ever the stomach bug was passed and my other 2 babies nor my husband and I never caught it. The dr said it was a terrible bug that entire families were catching but with the help of clorox and some infection control no one else caught it.
