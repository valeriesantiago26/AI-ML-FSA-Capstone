# AI-ML-FSA-Capstone
AI/ML Fullstack Academy Final Capstone Project
Github: https://github.com/valeriesantiago26/AI-ML-FSA-Capstone.git

This project explores customer product reviews in an e-commerce setting, focusing on sentiment analysis, fake review detection, and summarization using classical ML and modern NLP techniques.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `FinalCapstone_Project.ipynb`: Covers Sections 1, 2, and 4.
- `section-3-deep-learning-nlp-for-review-analysis.ipynb`: Covers Section 3 with deep learning models (RNN and BERT).

## üîç Sections Overview

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Analysis
- Cleaned and explored review data
- Visualized review length, sentiment, and grammar usage

### 2. Feature Engineering & Predictive Modeling
- Built ML models to detect fake reviews
- Evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and anomaly detection models

### 3. Deep Learning & NLP for Review Analysis
- Trained an RNN and a BERT model to classify fake reviews
- Compared model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves

### 4. Review Summarization App using LLMs
- Built a Gradio web app that summarizes multiple user-input reviews using a transformer-based model

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, Gradio
